Let me start by saying that this place puts other Chinese takeout spots to shame on so many levels. I'll try to name them all:

1. It is nice, bright, and super clean.
2. It has a real wooden table with real wooden chairs AND a nice little sushi bar for those who choose to eat in. Those who have attempted to ""eat in"" at your typical Chinese carryout place will know why this is mentioned.
3. Staff is friendly.
4. Non-canned vegetables are used in their dishes.
5. The chicken was much more high-quality than the norm at such places.

We shared 2 sushi rolls, a dumpling appetizer and the garlic chicken. Food was well prepared and came out fairly quickly. Everything was very good, with the sushi being a pleasant surprise.

If we're in the area, we'd definitely eat here again.","2016-05-19 12:47:05"

Well, its not all that. I ordered the Hunan Chicken and Hot & Sour soup. The chicken dish was okay. Could have used a little more heat. Portion was a bit smaller than I was used to but still adequate for a single dinner. The soup however was not even close to being palatable. No heat, No sour, wrong mushrooms used, no tree ear fungus, and what's with the corn and broccoli in it ? No lily buds either. Just plain wrong all the way around. Even PF Chang can do an acceptable H&S soup. Another in our group had the salmon sushi rolls. 4 of the 5 got thrown out. Not up to the usual standards. Won't be back.","2015-10-23 20:35:42"

There is an extensive menu.  Sushi, chinese, japanese, and curry options, so there is something for everyone.  

As strange as this may sound, the highlight of the meal for me was the free appetizers they gave at the beginning of the meal.  There was a ""hot cucumber"" item (for lack of a better term) that was simply amazing.  The cucumber bits were still nice and crisp, but had a hot tangy flavor to them.  I asked if I could get seconds and they were nice enough to oblige.

My fiance and I split a Rock N Roll and it was tasty.  Not that original, but we both enjoyed it.  It had a lot of flavor and each of the flavors did stand out.  

I ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner bento box and was quite pleased.  It came with my choice of soup (I had hot and sour), a sald, white rice, and then several choices for sides.  You were able to choose either tempura vegetables, chicken katsu or seaweed salad, shumai, Gyoza or a spring roll and a choice of one of three sushi rolls.  It was a bargain for the amount of food you got at $15.

The restaurant is not marked aside from a sign on the wall of the doorway. Once inside, the whole place is filled with beautiful woodwork. The ceiling kept me visually occupied for a really long time. The food itself has everything you'd expect from a Muramoto restaurant. The sushi selection is as good as their more sushi focused hilldale location. You can get the combo platters that's chef's choice, though if you really love/hate certain fish, they're generally really great about making those accommodations. The hot food has a nice variety of dishes to choose from. The black miso cod that's pretty much a muramoto staple is always a great option. The pork belly is very flavorful, with cloves of garlic stuff inside the meat. And it comes with their housemade kimchi. The brisket has great flavors, though toward the end, it does get a bit salty if you eat the whole portion on your own. The fried chicken has a very light crust, definitely not your traditional fried chicken.
They also have daily specials that range from small amuse bouche type things to larger plates that you can share.
Overall, it's great to have a restaurant back in this part of downtown that has the quality of sushi that muramoto does.","2017-04-20 03:31:36"

The Space:  Just like the old Muramoto that was there, its a great space and feels like a 'big city' restaurant.  Dark, calm, cool, and the lighting is superb.  Great date place and it just feels sexy.

The Food:  I wanted to like it, I really did.  We ordered a wide variety of small plates and not ONE of them was good.  In fact, even they even managed to blow bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese.  Now thats not easy to screw up.  The plates ranged from merely ok to bad (octopus 'balls' were like fried croquettes with elastic bands in the middle).  

The Drinks:  Drinks were good.  Good pours, good selection and the Japanese booze was interesting.  

The Price:  Here's why Kushi Bar received an extra star.  The place is cheap for what it is, especially the drinks.

So all in all, go for drinks, ambiance and to impress a date.  Maybe even order a small plate or two but don't expect it to taste as gourmet as it sounds on the menu...","2009-06-03 02:07:02"

I had never been to the downtown location before, I had only been to the Hilldale location for lunch, so I was interested to see if there was a difference.
There was a large group of us but we were able to sit in the back room so we had our own private dining area which was extremely nice.
We all got cocktails to start, I tried the Asian Margarita which was basically a lychee margarita and loved it. It had a nice lychee flavor without being overly sweet. I tried three other cocktails that my friends ordered and they were also great. I was honestly pretty surprised that there cocktails were as good as they were because I feel like I normally only get cocktails that taste that good from places that are dedicated cocktail bars, rather than at restaurants that serve cocktails.
For food, I split the chef's choice that came with 1 specialty roll, 1 inside-out roll, and 1 regular roll for $20 because we were having trouble deciding on which rolls we wanted. Maybe we got lucky, but the three rolls we got were right up our alley in terms of flavors we liked! We got the rainbow roll, maybe the negihama?, and the spicy tuna roll. All three rolls were also very sizeable with 2 of them being 8 pieces and 1 of them being 6 pieces. It was a fantastic deal considering the amount of sushi we got and the quality of the rolls.

We had two rolls, one eel and avocado and another tuna, avocado and some other stuff - both were fantastic. After seeing someone else with it, we also ordered the calamari with slaw and chili paste and, by far the best dish of the evening, the black miso seared cod. I've been remembering that cod all weekend, it was so good. There were a lot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try as well. Maybe another time.

Actually, everything was really, really good. This was a place I would want to revisit if I lived in Madison. Although we didn't order anything off it, they did have a specials menu with at least three items, and the very extensive sake menu. 

Contrary to what one of the other reviewers said, I think it would be really hard for the average person to spend $100 alone unless you just stuffed yourself silly. We ordered five dishes total and two small bottles of sparking sake to share among three women and the bill was $85. Actually I couldn't quite believe how reasonable the bill was when it came.

Chicken broccoli combination with a pint of wonton took less than ten minutes, and everything was correct. Glad to see a brown sauce was made, and NO FUCKING BEANSPROUTS in the fried rice. The latter is a huge plus, nice.

Wonton soup is well seasoned and has 5 generous, home-made wonton dumplings stuffed with pork, and garnished with green onion. Real good. Eggroll fried cleanly and not dripping in oil, good portion size.

Sushi, rice, in a seaweed wrapper.  The rolls were fresh and light. 

Lamb Curry
The lamb curry comes with rice and is a mix of the lamb with potatoes, and carrots in the curry sauce.  

Pork belly
The pork belly, served on a bed of kimchi and seasons with garlic has a good taste, but was not as soft as I would expect for brisket. 

Edamame
The edamame is served in a fairly standard way. The soybeans came out salted. They were served cold which I found to be a bit jarring.

Notice that all of the 5-star reviews are by users with only 1 or 2 reviews. They probably gave one another most of their useful/funny/cool votes. In fact, Gabrielle Y.'s original review was removed by the Yelp admin, but a new one was posted IMMEDIATELY (literally within a few minutes). I urge my fellow Yelpers to read everything carefully and decide for yourself which ones to trust.

My original review is below:
--
Wow, I haven't been this disappointed in a long time. My fianc¨¦e and I had been excited about coming here since we first saw the signage outside last month, and we finally came today (a Saturday), around 11:30 AM. The first thing we noticed is how disorganized the place is; they were busy training a new employee and none of the others was dealing with the line of customers waiting to order. The place wasn't super busy, maybe a dozen people eating and 4 others in line ahead of us.

The way this place works: ingredients are separated into meats (which include fish, shrimp, etc.), vegetables, and ""mixed meats"" (fish balls and quail eggs). You tell them which ingredients you want, they put them all in a bowl, and cook in a soup with your broth of choice. Meats are $2 each, vegetables $1, mixed meats $1.50. While the concept is fine, the poor organization here means ordering is very inefficient. The staff are Chinese and so are we, but they didn't know the names of several items we asked for. I imagine it would be even more confusing for English speakers. They don't have a large quantity of the ingredients on the counter, so they are constantly running out of things and running to replace with a new batch. They also failed to keep track of what ingredients we ordered, and we had to help them add it up. All in all, ordering was a messy ordeal and I don't want to imagine how they handle the crowds during busier times. 

Personally, I think they should let customers fill their own bowl and pay by weight (like most similar places in China), or a fixed price per bowl (like the Mongolian grill type places in America). By charging different prices for different ingredients they may be squeezing out better profit margins, but at the cost of poor operating efficiency. I also think they should call your number and have you pick up your order at the counter, rather than trying to bring it to your table, which they can't find and end up constantly calling out numbers anyways. At the very least, they should let customers get their own chopsticks, napkins, and cups of water - it's yet another extra burden on the already disorganized staff. 

We asked for ""slightly spicy"" broth but what we got lit our mouths on fire. I don't know if they misheard or just don't have anything less spicy, but keep that in mind. They don't give you white rice, so make sure you order enough for the soup. My tongue was completely numb so I can't comment much about how the food tastes. But my fianc¨¦e had stomach cramps during the drive back home, and ended up getting sick. 

Overall, it seems that the owners didn't do sufficient preparation before opening the restaurant. They should have had the staff properly trained and rethought their operation procedures. As of right now, the place is a complete mess, which is a bad sign for a place that just opened and should have had things planned out. I won't come back because of the food poisoning, but in any case I would urge them to consider adopting the self-serve model of several other nearby eateries (Spoon House, Sushi Ichiban, etc.). It would significantly speed things up while not adding to their costs.

Anyways I came here for a dinner on a Monday night. I love sushi so I was excited to try another Madison Sushi joint I had heard good things about. My significant other and I were meeting our friend who had arrived earlier. We were all immediately greeted and told we could either wait for a table in the main area or an immediate one in the back room. We choose the back room. It is just a smaller room with only two table, nothing wrong with that! I did like that is was more quiet and private.

We started out with drinks. I tried the honey ginger sake hot. They infuse it in house and I have to say this was delicious! The flavors paired very well with the residual sake flavor. It was nice and hot which was a nice contrast to the rainy dreary day it was. 

For food I ordered the Miso soup to start and the Fire Roll(the table shared this one), Spicy Shrimp Roll and the New York Roll. The Miso Soup was one of the best ones I have had in the area. It had your classic Miso flavor but with a little bit of heat and was not bland at all. 

All of the rolls we had were very fresh tasting and had great flavor to them. There was not to much rice which was nice. Overall our meal was very balanced. We mostly stuck to sushi but some of there hot entrees look very good as well. My favorite was the Fire Roll this one had a kick to it and tempura Salmon. I had never had Salmon in the tempura style before but it was very good. 

Overall this was a great experience and we were happy to find another sushi restaurant we enjoyed. We decided we would definitely be back to try more of the menu!","2018-05-22 18:58:02"

The food is much better than the surrounding Chinese take out joints. While nothing about this restaurant is ground breaking, the taste is pretty on point. I will say though that I'm tempted to give a lower rating because of the customer service. The woman at the front who takes the orders is never really friendly, clearly doesn't want to be there and just makes it seem like your presence annoys her. While the food is good, it's bad for business to have someone with a bad attitude running the front of your store. Also, don't bother asking to modify an order, they're very snippy and short about it, which is annoying. Also there's no room for a real dining experience, but I guess that's not really the type of business model they chose.","2013-03-24 22:30:54"

I'm not cooking anything on Christmas""!  In desperation I investigated and found that most Chinese restaurants are open so we ended up going to our favorite place, House of Hunan in Fairlawn, which we did every year until we relocated to SE Michigan about 14 years ago.  We kept up with this there as well, usually going over the border to Windsor, until we moved back to Ohio in 2014.  Since we now live in Cleveland, we tried Siam Cafe last year, which was very good; however this year, we decided to take the trek back to the House of Hunan.

Unfortunately, my wife wasn't feeling well enough to go out so we decided to get takeout and, since virtually none of the restaurants in ""Asia Town""  seem to have a website with access to an updated menu, my daughter suggested we try China Cafe based on their menu and the mostly positive reviews on yelp and google.  Well, there's nothing really remarkable here, the food was OK, comparable to our go-to takeout joint in Lakewood, New China King.  Actually, it's probably not quite as good.  The hot & sour soup was OK, my daughter was not impressed with the seafood pan fried noodles (although the tiny lobster tail portion was nice, the noodles didn't seem to be pan fried, just regular boiled noodles).  I ordered two small items, chicken with black bean sauce and hunan beef.  The former was pretty good; however in the latter, although the sauce and accompanying vegetables were good, the beef wasn't very tender. I also requested the hunan to be spicy, but it was quite bland.

Bottom line, since New China King is closer, we're within their delivery area, they typically deliver hot food to us (in SE part of Kamm's) within 20-30 minutes, the food is a little better, the online ordering service (which I really like) is EXACTLY the same for both places, and the prices are comparable, I see no reason to replace New China King as our usual takeout spot.","2015-12-26 16:00:11"

In a handful of visits since it opened a few years ago, I've found Muramoto to have generally outstanding food and often less-than-ideal service.  IMO, the former more than makes up for the latter, which is at its worst just a bit slow and unconcerned.  (Once, for example, we were two dishes into our meal before our first round of drinks arrived.)

But, ahh, the food.  This is probably the most creative food in Madison.  I describe it as pan-asian fusion in a tapas form factor.  There is some sushi, and some is even pretty good (I'm thinking of the signature duck mango avocado rolls).  That said, it's a mistake to think of Muramoto as a sushi place, though (there is a Muramoto sushi restaurant in the hilldale area ) -- my favorite dishes here have included the soy cod, a lamb curry, and a few amazing salads.  In my experience, the oft-changing menu contains little that isn't great -- an omnivore with an open-minded palate could safely close their eyes and just start pointing.

Come with an appetite and prepare to spend a bit of change (dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert will exceed $100), and avoid the tables in the front near the door on cold days.","2008-02-28 12:27:07"

I saw their ads a few months ago and was very excited. My husband and I gave it a try two days ago, and I have to say that I'm very disappointed about the food they offered. 

First, what you may want to know: I came from Sichuan, China where Chinese style spicy hot pot was originated from. What this restaurant's supposed to offer, spicy tang, is basically a fast food version of hot pot: you ordered food and they'd cook it for you. The most important factors for a good spicy tang are (1) plenty of choices of the food you can choose, and (2) the food has to be fresh and cooked just about right so it remains crunchy.

Unfortunately, what this restaurant actually offers is none. Their choices of food are few and are frozen food that you can easily find at a Chinese/Korean grocery store. They don't offer potato slices, seaweed, or sweet potato noodles, which are considered must-haves in spicy tangs and they not hard to be found in Asian grocery stores. Their lotus root slices are basically frozen ones and taste horrible; they don't even bother to buy fresh lotus roots and cut them by themselves. To be honest, I think everyone can cook the exact food by themselves using the ingredient they can easily find in Asian grocery stores and don't need to spend $15+ at this place.

I would suggest the owner to be more serious about opening a restaurant business. At least prepare fresh food and don't just buy frozen ones from super market. Also, I'm not sure whether the owner is aware of this, but the hot pot ingredients brought in Asian stores may contains pork or cow fat. I'd suggest you clearly mark it so that vegetarians or people with religious beliefs won't accidentally ate it.","2015-08-24 23:55:32"

At most, there were two other parties eating at around 12:45.  The interior is somewhat industrial (the omnipresent Edison bulbs) but the dark wood tables, floor, and surroundings makes it feel cozy.  I was slightly turned off by the dirty windows looking out onto the street.  They were recently cleaned (I could see the squeegee lines) yet it must have been with mud as they were completely streaked.
I sat the sushi bar and ordered the Sushi Combo #1 (chef's choice 1 roll & 7 nigiri) as well as a cup of Miso Soup.  The roll and nigiri were well constructed and the fish fresh.  I thought the salmon nigiri was some of the best I've tasted in Madison.  The Miso Soup was flavorful but at $4 for a small cup wasn't not worth the asking price.  Service was prompt and attentive.
Muramoto doesn't have a large lunch menu beyond sushi so maybe that (or that it is still fairly new) is the reason for the light crowd.  I would't hesitate to return for sushi.  Next time, though, I hope the windows don't look like they were submerged in a dusty vat of darkness.","2017-02-15 19:46:27"

By the beard of Zeus, I think I found it. Not only do they have Chinese food, but they also have Japanese and sushi as well! First off, I am in love with the online ordering with the little cart that follows you around. So convenient! Second, the food is amazing.

We ordered the crab Rangoon as a pre-appetizer...appetizer, the Volcano roll as an appetizer, plus the General Tso's chicken and cashew chicken as entr¨¦es. Yea, we may have over done it a little...
The crab Rangoon was delicious! Crispy, yet creamy on the inside without the crab overpowering everything. The sushi came in this cute little carry out container with flowers on it! Adorable and tasty. It was fresh and cool despite being packed in a bag of hot food. Which is no easy feat, so hats off to Wild Fusion.

Now for the main event! Combo platters. You know them, you love them. Here, they are perfect. The General Tso's was breaded to perfection and came in wonderfully large pieces with fried rice. I hate overly breaded and fried chicken...but that's not here, oh no. The cashew chicken was a little bland, but it was still good. Not only did we order all that, but the graciously gave us some free desserts! Maybe it was because the two of us ordered for eight people and it's some kind of quantity prize. Who knows, I'll take it! 

One last little pro in the ongoing list...they gave us napkins, sauces, and chop sticks. I really appreciate a Chinese restaurant providing all of those things in a takeout bag. Especially the chop sticks, which I have a love/hate relationship with. Love the idea, frustrated by the fourth piece of chicken.

I strongly recommend trying this restaurant.","2014-09-04 15:43:17"

Muramoto is a small, intimate restaurant with really cool Japanese hipster vibe much like Morris Ramen next door. I don't get a weeaboo vibe from them, so don't start getting all ""oishii gocheesosama deshda arigato gozaimasu"" when you're there. At 8 pm on a Saturday, it was actually fairly quiet. The place was only half full, and they managed to block the noise from the loud pride festival outside. The menu has some interesting, fairly-priced hot items, but I came for the sushi. Each sushi item had a very appetizing description talking about the origin, preparation, and flavor of the ingredient. It was difficult to not just order everything.

I started a large sushi combo plate for $25. That may sound like a lot of money for a roll and 9 pieces of nigiri, but it's actually an awesome deal considering how generous they are with their fish portions. Mine came with an octopus and scallion roll, bonito, albacore, blue fin (at mid-fattiness or chutoro), escarol, scallop, sweet raw shrimp, smoked salmon, yellowtail, and chilean sea bass. I'm not going to describe it all in detail since that would take forever, but it was all awesome. Everything was so flavorful and intentional. I was at a place owned by one of Jiro's trainees a few weeks ago, and this was pretty much just as good. I got some more of my favorite nigiri and sashimi pieces afterwards. My favorite was probably the uni (sea urchin). If you're an adventerous sea food eater and have never tried uni, the sweet, creamy, fishy flavor will make you fall in love with sushi all over again.

My only complaint was the rice. It wasn't warm and was kind of mushy and pasty. It didn't ruin the roll, but I found myself eating around it when eating nigiri. I will probably order most things as sashimi from now on.

When I got my bill, I was pleasantly surprised by how little it cost. I had a world-class sushi feast for 2 people for under $80 after tipping generously. I will be back soon.","2017-08-20 03:21:21"

Then we had an Asian slaw with cabbage, daikon, other veggies and a light, tasty sesame dressing.  We had some excellent rolls. And tempura walleye which could match or exceed any Friday fish fry in Wisconsin.  
For dessert we had a delicious ginger flan with a caramel sauce.  A cool, light way to end an excellent meal.  
Sometimes they have black sesame ice cream for dessert.  It has a lovely rich buttery taste.  Far better than the standard mochi ice cream at other places.

For those who want more detail in a review: I came here on a whim to try something new. I got a tiny bit anxious when I saw no menu displayed anywhere, but the staff at the counter was kind and gave a small brochure menu that had  pictures on it of the pre-made orders (you could also make your own - cost was determined by how many items you put in it) and gave me his recommended item - the beef and noodle soup. Since I had no preconceived idea of what I wanted and I figured something basic would tell me a decent amount about their food quality and preparation, I decided to order just that.

It didn't take that long for the soup to arrive, but it wasn't that busy when I had ordered, though a decent amount of people came in after me- not too many that it got crowded, but enough to tell me that this wasn't a place that got few customers. But I digress. The presentation was kind of unique - it came in a black pot/kettle with chopsticks, a fork for those not comfortable with the chopsticks, and what I think is a broth spoon . I thought it tasted quite good by itself. I added some spicy taro to it and I liked it better that way, but that's a personal preference. 

I finished it all, full and satisfied. Admittedly, it was a bit more than I would have liked to pay (9.40 is what I paid), but I had a good enough time and enjoyed what I had that I can deal with it.

First - it's a hard thing to pick which direction to go in. Chinese, Japanese, or Sushi. I'm a sucker for flavored chicken so to have Bourbon, Mango, Honey Chicken and Coconut Shrimp to choose from would be too hard. The hibachi choices all sounded great as well, but it was the sushi that made us try it and the reason we'll be back. 

Large portions and great prices - the prices are almost too cheap, they could easily price these higher and we wouldn't hesitate to pay it. Their dinner hibachi portions even for shrimp & scallops combo is under $11 - a large specialty sushi roll is usually just about $9 or so, and the dinner combos for the chinese menu are only about $7.50. 

Big fan, nice staff, and I like that you can see into the kitchen and see that it is large, clean, and well staffed. It makes you feel better about the food, especially with the reputation that some other Chinese locations notoriously have. 

Only cons to this place is the parking can be pretty cramped but that is no fault of their own, and only one table (there is also a sushi bar with a couple seats) inside but just about everyone does take out so it makes sense. Keep up the great work, we'll be regulars now!","2014-08-24 17:11:08"

We had a medium hot pot with tonkotsu broth. The food was decent. The sesame sauce was the best part of the Hot pot!
I love the Spicy Stir Fried even more!!! I'd say it definitely tasted much better than what we had in EVO and is probably the best spicy stir fried on campus. It was authentic, delicious, and just the right amount of spicy! I will definitely come back for more of that. Nom Nom Nom!!!
The service was also wonderful. With the cashier's help, it was easy for us to figure out what to order the first time we went. We didn't wait long to get our food either.

All info I've seen says 'tapas style', but I will tell you - these plates are not too small, and quite filling. Their other spot cross town is an incredible sushi restaurant with everything under the sun. Here, only have a few rolls on the menu (and they are incredible), but that is not why you come. Come for the tasty, hot dishes, and for the sake flights.

Every so often, you eat a meal that is soooo good, so perfect in almost every way, and the tastes are so unforgettable, that you want to get right up then and there, and do what I affectionately call, The Food Dance. This is food that makes your eyes roll back into your head with every bite, and leaves you wondering where the hell you have been eating all these years. This was, hands down, my saving grace in Madison. Presentation of the food is spectacular. Eating alone? Sit at the bar and stare at um-teen bottles of Japanese sake. Eating with a group? Even better, as the sushi rolls they do have there (soft-shell crab or avocado and mango roll w/ thin-sliced duck breast on top, drizzled with a duck reduction sauce, or a few others) are HUGE. Don't think California sushi, as each roll which costs $10 has about ten large slices, and you will find it hard to eat an entire one by yourself. These rolls would easily be double the price if this was in SF.  Look for Michael, the tall, bald-shaven, server/barman that knows everything about the menu, and can recommend many good sakes on the list. Try the sake flight (3 glasses) for a nice accompaniment to any meal. Now for the best part........you want small slices of some of the tastiest beef anywhere? Get the hangar steak. Not a large portion (meaning not a whole steak) but you get several slices of this beef, drizzled with a white miso-bleu cheese sauce that is to DIE FOR. Not a fan of bleu cheese? No worries, as the taste is made subtle by the combining with miso. But please, do yourself a favor - ORDER THIS DISH! Not a big beef fan? That's fine, as the Grilled Miso Black Cod is their signature dish. My suggestion? Start with some sake, and order yourself one sushi roll, and one hot dish. Take a few people, and everyone order a few different things, and share. And won't you be happy when you get out of there, after all this tasty food, and still you are not over the per diem. And if you are, maybe you shouldn't have had that third drink. Be advised - this place has a little wooden sign in the window, and it took me forever to find it. Do me one better, and take the address WITH YOU when you go!","2007-09-22 08:07:47"

Criticism-wise, there is a bit of a problem with seating in the wintertime, as there is quite a draft coming in from the door if you sit too close to it.  Moreover, you cannot make reservations at Muramoto.  This means of course that you cannot request a table further away from the door if you want to in advance (first come first serve).

Service is just fine, ambiance is lovely.  Come with a date, not your kids and definitely not in your red UW sweatshirt.  Dress to impress; this is a spot for grownups only.

!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!! 
Downtown Muramoto has moved to an new location, which is interestingly just down the road from their old location.  This solves the drafty chill issue, there are LOTS more seats, and you can now make rezzos.  On the downswing, it's missing something of its original, uniquely Madisonian charm.  It now has vaulted ceilings, adequate lighting, and at least one waitress of questionable moral character.  Plus they have an additional location by the Hilldale Mall which is yet another step down.  I think what I'm saying is that Muramoto sold out to the man and is now no longer actually hip or trendy.  But honestly, it's still quite nice and the food is very good.  The new Hilldale location does not have the oyster shots, but they do have a delicious octopus salad which knocks me sockies off.  You might as well keep going.","2008-03-11 02:17:28"

General Tso could be a lot better. While the sauce is awesome and has a good balance of the sweet and spicy, it is far from crispy as General Tso usually is. I attribute this to being served in a plastic with no ventilation. It just makes the saucy chicken soften up an cook in all the heat compacted in.

I don't live more than 5 minutes away and have always showed up while my orders will still being made...just not sure while the general Tso chicken is more soggier.

D and I normally order the hibachi dinners (she'll get chicken and i get chicken and shrimp). these come with salads which are really good. I'd go so far as to say the hibachi dinners are better than the ones we've had at a nearby ""Japanese"" restaurant (ahem... Samurai)

I have to admit that I was a little skeptical at first, but because of strong and highly reputable word of mouth recommendations, I headed to China Sea Express to try out their secret menu Taiwanese food.

I was saddened when Garden Cafe (a small Taiwanese restaurant) closed because of the hole that it left for good beef noodle soup (""niu rou mien""). Beef noodle soup in Cleveland is BACK. 

We came on a Saturday evening right before a performance at Playhouse Square so it was a little busy. However, we were promptly seated. The waitress redirected us to the owner for our special off-menu order. 

My bf and I both had beef noodle soup ($6.95) -- ""hong sao niu rou mien"". The beef noodle soup broth was sooo good... very flavorful and authentic! I could distinctly taste that carrots had been stewing in the broth for many hours. The noodles and the beef (says the bf) were pretty decent, though not mindblowing. I'd definitely recommend the dish just for the broth though!

Since he has a good eye, he spotted the platter of handmade dumplings on the table behind us. Apparently they make beef and pork dumplings by hand. We ordered some dumplings ($6.95) and they had pretty good flavor and thick dumpling skin. Not the highest presentation points as it was clearly handmade, but we definitely thought they were pretty good.

The owner and his wife came over and chatted with us for a while. They are Taiwanese, and while they are very fluent English speakers, speaking in Mandarin with them definitely helped us connect better. I'd give this place an extra half star because of how hospitable they were to us. They told us that they don't put MSG in their food (at least off-menu?) because it's what they like to eat themselves. Huge plus.

I would love to go back. My next question for them is... do they have tomato beef noodle soup? (fan qie niu rou mien?) If they do... game over. drool.","2012-04-24 02:18:11"

It has an trendy and intimate atmosphere which is perfect for catching up with a friend or a date night.This place is small so it is not a good spot for large groups. I would also recommend getting a reservation.

I had the walleye tempura as an appetizer and it was delicious. We then ordered a few drinks and they were AMAZING. I would highly recommend the killer bee(gin based) and the lychee martini. The sushi was good as well. We had the maki combo which was a chef's special that includes a regular roll, inside out roll and a specialty roll for only $20. A steal. It was enough for both of us to get full along with the appetizer. We added on a cali which was overkill but, we wanted to try it. The plating surprised me since it all comes on one cool square plate. Very enticing.

Sesame Crusted Big Eye Tuna with tahini sauce - I love it!  The sauce is so nutty and tasty and goes perfectly with the tuna and mixed greens.

Rock Crab Croquettes - it's their version of crab cakes but they deep fry the croquettes (4) and they arrive at your table piping hot.  They're delicious! - reminds me of my beloved dungeness crabs back home.   

Shrimp and Spicy Coconut Sauce with crushed peanuts - this is pretty good.  It's very similar to Thai food.

Hangar Steak with bean salad in bleu cheese & miso dressing - both times I've had it it's been a little tough and very chewy.  The bean salad (scattered around the steak on a long rectangular plate) drenched in the dressing is quite good.

DESSERTS
We ordered the Sample Platter.  I'm glad we did because we were able to try some really interesting desserts.  This Platter is perfect for two people.

Yuzu (Japanese Citrus Fruit) Panna Cotta - a little more firm than normal panna cotta.  Didn't really taste the citrusy fruit.  But it was very good.  It kind of reminded me of a smoother version of cheesecake without the graham cracker crust.  It also had a drizzle of some berry compote.

Strawberry Spring Roll w/Honey ginger ice cream - I really liked the spring roll.  It was nice and hot and I think there was some sweetened sticky rice in it as well.  I'm a big fan of ginger but for some reason I didn't like the ice cream.

Honey Black Sesame Creme Brulee - this was not my favorite but it was interesting.  The creme wasn't super creamy but had a little texture to it.  The color of the creme was a dark charcoal grey and tasted like smokey sesame.  It's a clever idea but not something I would try again.

Prices are good for this level of authentic food.  Only place I know in the Cleveland area to get authentic Taiwanese food.

Skip the buffet- ask the waiter for recommendations on the Taiwanese food from the Chinese menu.  They are eager to please and to show the world what authentic Taiwanese food tastes like.  Then see if you really think this place is a one or two star place.  

I'm not sure why the other three good reviews have been voted down.","2012-03-12 02:02:38"

Think Japanese Tapas. Reviews prior to November at this location should be thought as applying to it's new location, just down the street. 

I was not impressed by the food at Kushi. Your order will come out quickly, because almost everything is fried, fried, fried. The exception is the Donburi -- something yummy on rice. Our Eel Donburi was solid, and decently priced for $8... but if you're a Midwesterner with a healthy appetite like me, don't think this will make a meal. 

I also have a complaint about the drinks. My Cosmo was delicious -- and also standard Cosmo size and price ($7). However, because they make all their mixed drinks here with sake instead of vodka, what you're getting really packs much less of a punch than what you'd get elsewhere.

The pluses are this: The atmosphere hasn't change since this was the pricey Muramoto, So it's a groovy low-lighting place to hang. Also, it's really reasonably priced. $4 drafts. $1.50-$2 things on a stick, $5.50-$8 for Donburi. So you can go out and feel like you're getting the ""Muramoto Experience"" without bleeding yourself dry.

Whenever there's pork belly on the menu, I suggest you order it. The pork belly had some crispiness and the sauce was sweet and savory.

I didn't have enough pork belly and rice to go with the portion.

The brisket was a bit drier than I would like but it had a delicious sauce that made the brisket more sophisticated, must have been the miso sauce. This was also served with a side of rice and seaweed salad.

It's got an upscale hipster vibe, so don't expect a super authentic Japanese experience. I will point out that they serve almost exclusively sushi, so don't expect to get other Japanese food here. 

I can safely say (after coming here about 3 times in the last few months) that this is the second best sushi restaurant in Madison (after Red). I do think the downtown location is better than the Hilldale location - it's less crowded, though it's much smaller. It's pretty hard to find (as is its neighbor, Morris Ramen), but it's well worth it. 

I would highly recommend getting their sample plates - the large plate ($25 for 9 pieces of Nigiri and a roll) and the maki combo ($20 for 3 rolls) are standouts. The large plate was delicious and quite a good deal, while the maki combo seems like a steal! 

Overall, their fish is fresh but not as fresh as Red. Their rolls are good, but not as creative as Red. However, they are quite significantly cheaper! They also don't get nearly as crowded as Red.

I work less than five minutes from here, so it's convenient, and I have to admit that when I think about paying $7 for a sandwich or a salad at a nearby shop, or paying $6 for the buffet, my frugality often leads me back to the trough.

The place is clean and the staff is attentive, and the lunch crowd keeps it busy.  There's a real mix of business people and students from CSU.  It's also heartening to see that a lot of the Asian students go here for lunch, although they rarely seem to order the buffet, and I'm not really surprised, because I don't think it really even approximates authentic Chinese cuisine.

There are a few items I favor: the curry chicken skewers, the General Tso's chicken; the peanut butter chicken and the green beans with black bean sauce are my usual fare.  I try to limit myself to two plates, but sometimes I go back for a third, and I'm rarely glad I did.

The peanut butter chicken is something that is unique to my Cleveland Chinese food experience.  I have seen it at other restaurants, but never in California or anywhere else I have gone.  It's creamy and a little sweet, but very tasty and has to be hell on your arteries.

I don't really care for the Cleveland style sweet and sour chicken either, which is merely strips of chicken that have been battered and deep friend - almost like fish.  You take as many of these as you want and then just ladle that sweet red glaze over them.  That's not the kind of sweet and sour I grew up with, and it doesn't appeal to me.

I find their eggrolls a bit bland, as well as their vegetable low mien.  I avoid the pork stuff and anything with shrimp, so I can't comment on their taste, but they look perfectly, generically acceptable for Chinese buffet fare.

Luckily, it mostly stayed the same, but the food and service didn't live up to the former place. I had been to Muramoto in its old space with the same experience, unfortunately.

Overall, Muramoto is a decent average sushi restaurant with fine dining sushi prices. My biggest critique is that the food prices are too high. I don't typically eat that much, but I found it difficult to spend less than $30 for a filling meal. I understand sushi-grade fish is expensive, but it would nice if there were some affordable options on the menu in addition to all the special rolls. I've eaten at other sushi restaurants without breaking the bank, so it's possible. An ideal combo would be something like a $10 special roll with 1 or 2 smaller $3 maki rolls. I ended up going with the maki combo ($20), which was the perfect amount of food, but also more than I wanted to spend. We also got an appetizer. The drinks were also higher than I expected, but not atypical compared to other places in Madison. 

The sushi was quite good, although service was spotty and it took a while for food to come out. I was with a group of 3 and the entrees also came out at different times.

That being said... i will more than likely come back to this place again to give it a shot, but for now, i'd say it's not my top 5 favorite restaurant in town quite yet. 

Also, don't be fooled by the storefront and the name. This place is more authentic than the name gives it and it's wayyyy bigger than it looks from the outside. give it a shot!

Beef Noodle Soup (3.8): This is the first time I've had beef noodle soup (niu ro mien) in Cleveland so it's hard to compare. I'd say it's pretty authentic to what I would've expected. The good news is... I have to applaud China Sea Express for using authentic beef noodle soup noodles- that's pretty rare to find in Cleveland (specially after all those failed 'ramen' restaurants in CLE). That really excited me. The beef is pretty authentic too with a good portion. The only thing was that the broth was a bit too much on the sweet side so if they could improve on the broth, it would be a pretty decent dish!

Steam & Fried Dumplings (4): my favorite part of the meal was their dumplings. It's homemade and although the dumplings are really small (I can probably eat 30 of their dumplings), the flavors and the skin is good!!! I recommend the pork & cabbage FRIED dumpling. 

Mapo Tofu (3): This was recommended by the owner and it was a bit better than i expected. The only issue (common issue at this restaurant) is that all i taste is the spice and the sweetness of the dish. I was expecting more salt + spice, not sugar + spice.

Green Beans + Pork (3): This dish does remind me of home since my mom cooks it alot. The saltiness flavor was there (yay) but it wasn't authentic. 

HOWEVER, after trying their green beans + pork dish, i'm very very curious about their jia-jiang mien. only because the pork sauce they used in the green beans dish tastes like jia-jiang mien sauce.

The food was great, but I felt compelled to provide this background -- if this is your first time, but certain you -- and your guests -- understand the difference between ordering a roll and a piece.  

As a group of newbies, we had a lot of questions about the menu including how many pieces in a roll and the waitress explained.  

One of our young guests arrived late, however -- after the explanation -- and proceeded to order multiple rolls and the waitress did not stop to ask if she understood what she was ordering.  (Our guest was a foreign exchange student and hadn't been to Muramoto - or other sushi place before.)  When a large tray of sushi -- over $75 -- was delivered to our table, we were shocked! 

The other comment pertaining to service:  all sushi rolls came to the table first.  The ""appetizers"" came last.  

The waitress never came back to ask how her food was.  It felt like we had been scammed.  Our guest left with two ""to go"" cartons.

The waitresses were ok.  I felt like it was just a group of students needing jobs to fill in the summer.  They made the experience feel awkward and even more weird by congregating to chat while missing queues from tables for miscellaneous requests.

Aside from this, the superstars of dinner were the sushi chef and his son.  I didn't realize the small dinner plate I ordered was omakase (chef's choice).  It included a roll and five pieces of nigiri for $15.  I asked for the tuna roll and was quickly corrected that the chef chose the roll. Thankfully the sushi chef might have heard me because the tuna roll made its way to my plate!  The cuts of fish were generous, skillfully selected and cut precisely.  I couldn't have asked for a more perfect plate for my undecided palette that night!

We chatted a bit about my travels to Shinjuku, Osaka and Kyoto.  Throughout the night we shared a couple stories and it really brought me back to Japan.  Get to know your sushi chef.  If you don't have any dietary restrictions ask them what is fresh and do everything omakase.

(Suggest they ask your level of spice when ordering.) 

I'd say this is above average Chinese food for the area, and a great value.  Looking forward to also trying the sushi.  Nice to have another good alternative to Hong Kong Caf¨¦, which is where I usually eat.","2015-08-19 19:24:27"

Like some of the others, this rating is based solely on delivery. They were pretty quick, too, so claps for that.

The place is reasonably priced and apparently, good for sushi cravings. I'm not much of a sushi person myself (I hate seafood), so I went with the Chinese side of the menu. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but decided to give it a shot anyways.

I got the boneless short ribs and General Tso's. Neither of which are particularly impressive, but neither are foul tasting. Of the two, the boneless short ribs was the winner--they were not as stiff as I expected nor were they as dry. There was a flash of cinnamon in addition to some other flavors I couldn't quite recognize. Mixed with the white rice, it made a perfect meal for a carnivore like me.

The General Tso's on the other hand, was a mild disappointment. Unlike a lot of other Americanized-Chinese places in town, the preparation didn't leave the nice, crunchy exterior. Instead, it was softer. And surprisingly, had a little bit of a zest that's usually muted in other General Tso dishes.

It wasn't the best Chinese food I've ever had, but there are a lot worse you could do. I may have been lucky and gotten a fluke of good food because it's Easter and not many people are probably ordering out--but at least it'll make good leftovers for work tomorrow.","2011-04-24 22:50:45"

We all love asain food so we were excited to try a new place while visiting UW. All six of the dishes we ordered were aweful. We started with crab rangoon (a safe choice and hard to screw up). It was greasey and tasted as if fried in old, dirty oil. They may have used motor oil for all I know. Here's the funny thing: it was the best item we ate for lunch, but it was aweful too. We all had a chicken dish, except my son who had pork dumplings which had more ginger and a mystery ingredient than pork - yuck! Four of the five chicken dishes had very little chicken. I would estimate 1/2 to 1 ounce of chicken (3 bites). My daughter's boyfriend ordered orange chicken because the restaurant was ""out"" of sweet and sour chicken. How is that even possible? He said his orange chcken didn't taste like chicken at all. Hum? My ""chicken"" was flavorless as if it was boiled and sitting in a vat of water until it was time to add to the dish. 

This place ranks as the number 1 worst restaurant I have ever eaten at, especially because all six dishes were so bad. It was also the worst $80 I have ever spent. The service was so poor too. When we asked the waitress if the the food was good, she replied, ""uhm, you decide"" in her asian acent. She did't provide appitizer plates, forgot the condiments for a few dishes, however she did keep the water glasses topped off. After the meal, the manager asked us if our meal was good (everyone's plates were still nearly full) and we replied, ""the food wasn't very good.""  We expected him to say, "" ya, we hear that a lot"", but he just nodded and walked away. Maybe the restaurant is named Dragon 1 because it is the number 1worst place to eat in Madison. I can only pray that there is not a Dragon 2, 3, or more. There are many other asian restaurants in Madison and I would strongly suggest any of them.","2014-01-05 15:13:08"

They have been open three weeks. We came in at 5:30 PM on a Saturday and there were about 20 people - some couples, some groups including a few families with kids. We were greeted and seated immediately and our drink orders were taken quickly. The menu covers a broad swath of Asia - available are Japanese soups and noodle dishes, sushi, Thai curries and Chinese entrees. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the staff was courteous and attentive. We ordered two pieces of sushi and a spicy tuna roll and they were delivered to the table in short order. The salad from our also-ordered sweet and sour chicken and the tempura shrimp for an udon bowl came shortly after. The sushi and tuna roll were very good and the tempura shrimp was perfectly cooked; crisp panko and tender juicy shrimp. I should point out that I rarely comment on salads in Asian restaurants; salad is never great in an Asian restaurant and is such a western addition to Asian cuisine that I think it should be avoided in favor of soup....but that wasn't my order. The sweet and sour chicken came with the sauce on the side and perfectly fried chicken served with flash-fried peppers, onions and sweet pineapple. All of the dishes were presented well and tasted fine. There was no new ground broken in the presentation, preparation or flavors and everything was quite good and just as one would expect. No disappointments but no stunning revelations either.

The price was agreeable, though. Two pieces of sushi, spicy tuna roll, sweet and sour chicken, Udon bowl and drinks came to $35. My family is such that we could easily order a Thai dish, a Chinese dish, a Japanese dish and some sushi were it only possible.....and now it's possible for what we consider a pretty affordable price, with good quality food and excellent service.","2014-12-28 01:58:02"

You can get a filling, relatively healthy (especially given that they now have a wider selection of salads and you can replace pasta with zucchini noodles!) meal for around $10.  My kid likes it, and she's picky.  My wife likes it, and she's picky.  I like it.  If you dont like it, they will make you something else, every time.

Pesto Cavatappi seems to be the universal favorite.  My wife also likes the Japanese Pan Noodles and the Southwest Salad.  I like . . . just about everything I've tried.  Some of the dishes are more bland, but you should be able to identify which those are from the descriptions.

One of our more frequent takeout options, despite them not being locally owned.","2018-06-28 18:00:49"

Although Mac & Cheese is always on our order, I tend to supplement all that gooey goodness with a salad and you can't go wrong with any of Noodles choices. The Caesar is pretty darn tasty with a hint of anchovies in the dressing and big crunchy croutons, The Med salad is another favorite that is quite filling on its own. Hubby tends towards the Mushroom Stroganoff with the yummy flatbread slathered in faux butter. Oh the Potstickers aren't half bad either.

Came a little later, after 8 pm, was  quiet.  
Calvin, the manager, was very attentive, and helpful.
Restaurant itself was clean, inviting
We wanted to try a little bit of everything-
Started with deluxe sushi dinner-
Fish was very fresh, generous portions- Very pleased with the quality.
Next, Calvin recommended a special dinner, Chilean sea bass over asparagus-
Again, all 3 of us were impressed- Fish cooked just right, excellent sauce ( had some nuts in it)-was light, complemented the fish well.
Last, we had a green curry with chicken, beef, and shrimp-
Perfect!
We tried a bottle of sake, and Calvin offered us a sample of a few others, all excellent

The front door doesn't have a second door so anyone sitting near the door was freezing.  I had asked the waitress to move me to a table further away from the door since it was so cold and the place was relatively empty.  She sat me down and said, ""Oh, sorry for the weather.""  Um...k?  

I had the pho last night.  It's actually pretty decent tasting, almost on par with the popular Saigon Noodles on the westside. However, the pho came in this ridiculous bowl that would make it difficult for anyone who really loves to eat the noodles with the broth, to eat both together.  My dining companion's dish also came in a ridiculous bowl that didn't really work for her vermicelli noodles.  The waitress wasn't that great; she forgot to bring me an actual spoon to use and left me with a ladle.  She also forgot to bring out the condiments (bean sprouts, basil, lime, jalepenos).  When I asked for it, she gave me a weird look and said, ""Oh yea... I'll go get that for you.""  

All in all, the pho was decent and I'd probably come back for it.  The service wasn't great and the food is overpriced, but I guess it has to be that way since it pays high rent on State Street.

A co-worker recommended this place as he and his wife's favorite.  Needless to say, he's fired for future recommendations...

We went with some generic dishes, stuff that every Chinese restaurant sells...kung pao chicken and sesame chicken.  I got the meal, so it came with an egg roll, and I also ordered a side of hot 'n' sour soup.  My kung pao had no sauce at all, it was basically just wok'd chicken and unremarkable veggies, and that's what it tasted like.  The hot 'n' sour soup looked good...but had zero flavor.  None.  Zip.  It's a mystery to me how they could've achieved the look without actually having ANY flavor.  I let my wife try it and her eyes popped open.  ""Wow!  There's no flavor at all?  It's like they boiled water!""  Actually, water probably would've had more flavor.  Oh, and I asked them to make it insanely spicy.  ""How spicy you want?""  I told her I wanted it so hot, the cooks in the kitchen complained.  Was it hot?  Not even in the slightest bit.  And I'm not saying that like, ""Oh, I'm so used to heat, I didn't think this was hot,"" way.  I mean an Amish person would've said, ""Wow, this is bland.""

I tasted my wife's sesame chicken and it at least had some flavor of sesame.  Both our chickens were overdone.  

We'd planned to eat in, but apparently, despite the fact that there are 6 or 8 tables, nobody dines in there.  They handed us our food in takeout packages, having not asked either way.

I got crab rangoon and hot and spicy chicken. The crab rangoon was pretty regular; it was hot and crispy but also chewy towards the interior with substantial cream cheese filling and a sweet sour dipping sauce. Thats exactly what I wanted.
The chicken sucked though. They used strippy chunks of breast meat. The actual meat tasted a little funky (perhaps it was freezer burned); i would hope for unmarinated chicken breast to have a neutral flavor. They used a good amount of vegetables which is reminiscent of typical kung pao chicken. The sauce wasnt very spicy at all; it was more sweet and salty. It kind of reminded me of a very mild buffalo sauce diluted in salad dressing before being warmed up again. The dish left my mouth with an aftertaste similar to barbecue potato chips.

Perhaps I just got a bad dish that i expected to be crispy thigh meat cooked in chili oil with onions. I'm definitely willing to try other things on their menu.

This review is based only on their sushi and nothing else as I did not try anything else. 

My date and I ordered 5 rolls: the Shrimp and Asparagus Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Unbelievable Roll, Blue Ginger Roll and the Sunday Roll. Let's start with the Unbelievable Roll- I can't explain the cream cheese but it is not the typical cream cheese used at other places. This cream cheese is soft and wonderfully paired with the sushi roll. The other great thing about this roll is the red snapper. You don't see very many places with red snapper on the menu let a lone in a sushi roll and boy oh boy was it fantastic!! The Blue Ginger roll is the most expensive because it has both filet and lobster but every bite is worth the splurge! The Sunday Roll was more like a dessert roll to me because it is topped with Mango with a mango sauce. It was not overwhelming and it was a great roll to split up the flavors of the other rolls we ordered.

This is a sushi place worth checking out! The prices are right and the flavors are powerful and every bite is delicious!

We've gotten two dishes-- beef pho and a rice stick noodle saute dish-- that have both been consistently excellent.  A glass noodle dish was not good at all and a lemongrass chicken wing appetizer was just ok.  

It's a bit annoying that they're still not serving all the dishes on the menu, including several dishes that are prominently featured in pictures in their menu and on the signs that they put up before opening.  The steamed seafood egg cup and stuffed angel wings are the most blatant offenders here, but they're also not serving any of their curry dishes or sandwiches.

The real problem, however, is the service.  The people who work at Dragon-I are, without exception, extremely nice, friendly, and seemingly hard-working.  However, it seems like most if not all of them have never worked in a restaurant before.  They really don't know what they're doing, and it shows.  They don't know the menu, don't know how to greet and seat customers, and don't know how to insure that orders are accurate and complete.

I have no doubt that the people they have working there could do a really good job, but they really need to look at their management.  There's a certain level of disorganization right now, as evidenced by the page of the menu that has (in very large font) what is clearly a series of abbreviations indicating edits that should have been made to that page.  That means that someone forgot to look at the proofs.

If they improve service, this will be a solid four-stars.

Edit:
It's been a few weeks since my review, and I'm downgrading this place to two stars.  The food is still fine, but the service is simply unacceptable.  When you make a mistake, the first thing that you should do is apologize.  That hasn't happened twice now, and it's incredibly annoying.  There are seven reviews for this restaurant and if I'm not mistaken every single one mentions some kind of service-related issues.  

To the owners of Dragon-I: If you're reading these reviews (and I wouldn't be surprised if you aren't), what you need to do is hire a competent manager ASAP.  Train your staff. Institute some actual procedures.  Make at least some attempt to actually get dishes out to a table at the same time.  I will gladly raise my review if you can raise your standards to those of any semi-competent restaurant.

(One more thing: they just ordered a bunch of drink menus that say ""Dragon One.""  Jesus Christ, guys, learn to actually look at the proofs when you order something.)

Edit 2: Service has been better the last few times I've gone in.  I'll bump it back up a star.

Edit 3: Virtually every time I go to Dragon-I there is something wrong with my order.  This is incredibly frustrating, since the food is pretty good.  Back down to two stars.","2012-10-25 22:46:08"

It was really just tofu swimming in a watery chili juice with a few tiny pieces of chicken in it. Wow, nope. I called and complained about this and the missing eggrolls and was promised free apps next time. I ordered last night and got the Hunan scallops. For 9 bucks, we had hoped for more than 5 thinly-sliced scallops. It was almost all broccoli and green peppers. BU HAO CHI. Also, there is a coupon for free crab Rangoon if you order over a certain amount. I asked to use that coupon, and they sent me TWO orders of crab Rangoon. So, instead of saving me money and comping the one order, they just charge me for the first order and throw in another. This seems shady. I made it very clear I only wanted one order of them. This has happened more than once.

Lastly, I ordered some sushi, which is usually passably good. This time, an entire roll (the Christmas roll) was fishy-tasting and inedible.

Getting right to it:

Food Quality: D

     I have eaten at nearly every Asian restaurant in Madison, and being asian myself, I cook Asian food often.  I enjoy all kinds of Asian food from splurges at Lao Laan Xang to very humble bowls of pho.  Disappointingly, Dragon-I's food was appalling.  I ordered a bowl of pho and the lemongrass chicken-  Both were awful. 
      The pho was scummy (it had remnants of leftover fat and other gross substances) because they hadn't skimmed the broth and cleaned the soup bones properly.  This left a gross film of fat all over the bowl and my mouth.  There is no question about it, this is the worst pho I've had ever, anywhere.  Also, the pho was served with a bizarre ladle to sip the broth instead of the conventional spoon.  Clearly Dragon-I is more focused on gimmicks than food quality.
     On to the lemongrass chicken:  I ordered this with the pho but the restaurant served it to me way after I was finished with the pho.  They brought out my check before the entree actually got to my table, because I had been done with my pho for a while and they thought I was done eating.  The lemongrass chicken itself was disgusting.  It contained no lemongrass whatsoever and most closely resembled a chicken dish you would get in a Chinese restaurant in a mall (it tasted EXACTLY like your standard-mall 'bourbon chicken').  It did not resemble a freshly cooked entre at all.  
     Finally, I ordered a mango bubble tea.  I watched my server make it from instant powder, it cost me $3 or $4 (I don't remember the exact price).  Anyways, if you are going to charge someone this price for a drink, at least make it from scratch.  You can go next door to the Tea Steepery and order the same thing for the same price and it is much, much better.   Dragon-I is not aware of how much they are lacking competitively to other restaurants in the area.  It is really sad that Dragon-I""s food quality cannot match that of their interior.

We talked to a couple waiters and the problem was not solved. Finally we got the manager. She was very nice.

Basically it was just white rice with soy sauce. No vegetables or flavor at all. 

Not only that, but no server came and asked us for drinks. Just gave us water which again wasn't a problem, however, if I a paying $30 for a meal for 2, I expect better food and service.

Considering Noodles and Company has their formula and recipes pretty well tested, I can say the quality of the food is pretty much on par with all of the other noodles I've been too. No complaints (or compliments?) there. 

We've been a little disappointed with the service at this location - staff isn't super friendly (though we do tend to go at busy times). The last straw, though was getting a take out order with a soup lid not firmly attached, causing the soup to spill all over the inside of the bag. Luckily they had the foresight to put the container of soup inside of another bag, which contain the spill to a minimum. Not the end of the world, we just ended up sharing the other entree who got in throwing out the soup.

I left some feedback for noodles via their website, and was contacted almost immediately regarding the problem. They made the standard apologetic overtures, and then offered a $5 gift card so that I could come back in and try noodles again. Why I don't like sounding unappreciative, the soup that we threw out cost more than $5, so I feel like it's going to take more than that to get us a roll the dice on this noodles location again.","2018-09-12 15:33:27"

I was so excited when Dragon I opened on State St, having a range of fusion food and serving bubble teas too! Unable to contain my excitement I organized a mini dinner session with 2 other friends. 

The first signs that something was weird was that our waitress did not take down any of our orders; she merely 'remembered' them. We decided to start with the korean spicy rice cakes. But we waited forever and our appetizer did not come. One by one the main course was served, and by the time we were all done, there was still no sign of our appetizer! 

I wish I could say that the appetizer was the only eventful thing that happened. But one of my friends ordered the korean spicy tofu soup (she's vegetarian). What they served her was korean spicy soup with beef. And so she spent half the time picking out the pieces of beef from the soup. Another of my friend had the Vietnamese stir-fry noodles, which took more than 25 min and we had to remind the waitress, otherwise we would go hungry. They did give us a complimentary fried rice, which we did not order. My guess is that the waitress probably 'thought' we ordered it, so the kitchen made it and decided to give it to us for free. By that point we were too fed up to even ask about our missing appetizer. 

Ever since that experience I haven't gone back for another shot. After sufficient time has passed for the memory to fade I might go return to give them a second chance. But right now I can't bring myself to say positive stuff about this place.","2014-05-06 19:14:11"

I am capable of eating Americanized Chinese food and realizing it still tastes good, but this was just not delicious for anyone's palette.
I got the appetizer spring rolls and the zhia jang mien or however the spelled it. It shouldn't matter how I spell it cause you just should not eat anything that seems like it could sound like that. So I know how these noodles are supposed to take. What I was served was nothing of the sort. I can't really explain what it tasted like, but it was not good. Furthermore, I asked for it extra spicy, and I think their extra spicy is milder that the chipotle medium. Which for an asian restaurant, is unacceptable. To make my dish edible I basically emptied an entire bottle of sriracha onto the plate. The appetizer was no better, When I bit into it, I couldn't identify any flavours or ingredients. I could see the carrot in the spring roll but nothing else was really identifiable visually either. The sauce was also watered down and not as tangy as it should have been.
Oh how disappointed I was.

They have huge selections just like other Chinese restaurant. Foods are generally good and kind of fusion, i guess. I have been in Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and China before coming to Madison, so I'm a big fan of Asian foods.

Based on my experience, some dishes are really good. my suggestions are... 
- Korean bbq short-ribs, also known for Korean LA Galbi, if you like korean bbq especially.
- Curry Katsu Don, which is pork wrapped with fried flour like tempura and japanese curry sauce as side.
- Korean kimchi fried rice (??).. The name might be wrong since I don't remeber exactly.. It was fried rice with Korean Kimchi and red pepper sauce. It was actually kind of sweet rather than spicy. So, i guess it was fusion.

However, i didn't like some dishes..
- Korean spicy noodle soup.. It was not even close to Korean dish (i have some expectation when it comes to Korean dish since i tried a lot before) The taste was really weired.

It's doing the fusion thing, so essentially Korean/Thai/Vietnamese. I am seated by a hostess/server who does not appear to understand much of what I say to her and given a room-temperature, plastic water cup.

I open the menu and decide I want to have some oolong tea, some kimchee, and the pad Thai with shrimp--""extra, extra spicy,"" I say while she nods along in empathy.

The kimchee appears a few moments later. It's fine. I then note, with some trepidation, that the server is bringing a giant, steaming styrofoam cup from behind the bar. I pray silently that this is not my tea, but of course it is: around a quart of boiling water with a teabag, about which she helpfully instructs me, ""Take this out in about two minutes."" I let the urge pass to explain that at most restaurants, the staff makes the food and drinks for you. The combination of far too much liquid and the insulated cup means that the tea doesn't cool down enough to drink until I'm ready to go.

The pad Thai arrives. It is big, but nothing else good can be said about it. It is oddly sweet, smothered in three times the appropriate quantity of crushed peanuts, barely features any shrimp, and appears to be the inverse of the spice level that I asked. 

As I grow tired of my molten tea and boring food, I await my check. But my server and another staffer are instead sitting at the bar having dinner two feet away from me, so I have to wait. The price for everything ($20) would actually have been reasonable if the food had been any good, which it really was not.

And so, dear Yelpers, I have learned that I need to check with y'all before eating anything else on State Street in this town, as looking up the rating may have saved me. Tourist districts are always like this, building business cultures where hardly anybody tries hard, because they've got your money and don't care if you come back.

It makes it seem as if the bowl is bigger, but really it's cylindrical from the bottom and has a wider top. Maybe I would have gotten a better price had I gone to a legit pho restaurant, I'm not sure because I'm not from Madison. 

There was more broth than noodles and there may have been like three slices of beef in the size of elephant ears. Our first server who greeted my friends and I was generally nice, but her coworkers...not so much. Perhaps they were new, I wouldn't know. We had to ask for two waters at least three times from three different people. I honestly could have gotten up, grabbed the cups from the shelf, and poured my cup of water that was in the pitcher next to our table, in less than a minute rather than what? Almost five minutes, maybe longer?

Plus, the staff are pretty rude to their chef too. He rings the little bell to let them know that food is ready to give to customers and this one girl snaps back at him, ""CAN YOU HOLD ON FOR A MINUTE?"" Like really? We're right next to you. Take it down a notch and he's just doing his job. If the food is cold, it's on you. It's also confusing when they refer to the number of the food rather than the name. Here's an example of my friend's order: ""Who ordered an NS-09?"" The heck is that?! It was a type of vermicelli Vietnamese soup. Are we supposed to remember the numbers? C'mon now.

Not the greatest place and my complain is mostly about the staff. The pho again was okay. It just seems like another restaurant more tailored to American tastes and likings rather than ours. Just saying.

I was looking to try something new for my birthday bash last weekend.  What I stumbled upon was a private karaoke lounge, tucked away in the upper lair of what I had previously assumed to be exclusively a bubble tea restaurant.  Or an exclusive bubble tea restaurant, however you want to look at it.  Recognizing that this was a chance to broaden my horizons as I entered into another year, I immediately walked in to put my name down for a room, which was then written on a scrap of paper smaller than a post-it note. Needless to say, I had my reservations about my reservation, but I also knew I was on to something great.

The song selection keyboard was in another language; the songs available were from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s, which means essentially anything post-Backstreet Boys was non-existent.  The music videos to accompany these throwbacks were of bears climbing up majestic mountains or wolves howling at a full moon.  The only downside was that the drinks were a little weak, but that didn't stop my friends and I from having a fantastic time.   

Overall, belting out karaoke classics at the top of my lungs in a private room made for an awesome birthday celebration.  I consider this birthday party at the Dragon I karaoke lounge to be the most entertaining, and therefore, my favorite to date.","2015-04-17 01:46:38"

I'm not exaggerating when I say he provided, hands down, the BEST service I have ever had at ANY restaurant (including expensive fine dining establishments) EVER!  Seriously!  Trash (aka sugar packets for tea or paper from the chop sticks etc) never sat on the table longer than a min or 2.  Plates constantly on the move as they were no longer needed, drinks refilled around half full so we never ran out, even asked us if we wanted him to box up the to-go box or would we prefer to do it ourselves (something that seems rare these days) and after we were done and headed out he even held the door for us.  Super polite, very speedy, very attentive, just amazing service.  Both my wife and I agree this was the best service we have had.  Gave him a nice tip, wrote him a note on the bill thanking him for his exceptional service, and thanked him in person as we headed out.  Let me also note that while we were eating someone that got takeout had forgotten something and he ran out into the parking lot (which was incredibly busy and dark) and ran around until he found them.

The dining room and menus are beautiful and that, combined with the pricing (most dishes around $8-10 and up - pretty standard for decent Asian food in Madison, I think) left me expecting food that was better quality than takeout, but not exactly fine dining.  

I ordered the Korean Beef Kimchi Fried Rice and I was served within 5 minutes of placing my order, which means it had been made before and just reheated.  Portions are also huge.  It was pretty greasy and, although I wasn't expecting authentic Korean food, there was nothing kimchi about it.  Furthermore, when I hear ""Korean beef"" I expect some pretty good quality beef, but the beef was a really poor, flavorless cut and I ended up just picking it out and eating the rice (and occasional radish).  Not exactly worth the $11 I paid for it.

As for the service... I don't think the servers are necessarily rude, they just haven't been trained at all and have obviously never worked in a restaurant.  My server wasn't rude, but the whole experience was really awkward.

All in all I would say that Dragon I is a beautiful dining room with high prices for takeout quality food and I probably wouldn't go back.  There's much better Asian food to be had in Madison in this price range - and there's cheaper takeout, too.","2013-02-21 04:36:53"

I got shrimp egg foo young and some lo mein noodles.  The egg dish had a very, very distinct ""fishy"" smell that could either be from old/""not-so-good"" shrimp or it was deep fried in oil that was also used to fry fish.  It is common knowledge that if shrimp smells ""fishy,"" it's a good idea to not eat it as its probably spoiled. However, in most cases, if spoiled shrimp is cooked, the smell usually does not linger so to have eggs smell this strong after deep frying was a little too much for me.  Plus, the egg foo young gravy was very different from what is typically served.  It was a very thin, soy sauce based sauce that was dark brown but clear and was quite sour with flecks of what could be garlic. However when I tasted it, I really could not tell.  As for the noodles, it tasted as if it was cooked with old grease.  There was a very distinct smell.  When food, especially noodles, are cooked with fresh oil, it is able to pick up flavors from the aromatics, meats, and vegetables that it is cooked with.  In this case, there was nothing more than a very clear and stagnamt smell that could only come from old grease.

One of the entres went back immediately because it was cold. Pretty disapointing considering we dont get out much and this was supposed to be a treat for us. 
The ambiance was terrible! Apparently they have Karaoke rooms upstairs that you can rent for $32 an hour (WHAT?!) in traditional Korean style. The sounds of flat off key singers coming accross terrible sound systems boomed through the building. Not only that but there was a table where all the restaurants office supplies were sitting out, like tape scissors, stapler and such. This was the right in the center front of the restaurant where your eye normally is focused on. I dont want to see your messy desk area, its unprofessional! The table we were sitting at had a split in it which came apart as we were leaving dumping my water all over me.

I cant say that the meat entres arent good because I didnt try them but the ambiance issues and annoying staff are reason enough not to waste your money expecially considering there are so many great restaurants in Madison.","2012-12-15 22:36:10"

From outside, you would never believe how nice the inside could be.  I know what your saying, ""hey Tom, who cares how nice the inside is, there are a million restaurants in the area that are aesthetically pleasing but the food sucks!""

They also have some great Tempura and Teriyaki dinners that come with green salad, soup, and rice, which is a very good deal.  We opted for a variety of sushi, which was fresh and the chicken and steak with Thai Basil sauce, which was really good.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly, stopping buy our table to see how everything was and if we needed anything at all.  We also noticed that their were a lot of people stopping by to grab take-out orders as well.  The evening ended on a great note when we decided to try the Green Tea Ice-cream (I know what you're thinking, that sounds awful.)

I'm not new to the menu or the people that work there from when they opened.  The sushi has been very inconsistent lately and the fish is not as fresh as it used to be.

I came here with some friends to get some sushi for half off but we sat at the bar because one of my friends wanted to drink as well.  It was pretty busy when we walked in too so we thought sitting at the bar would cut the wait time.  There was an older gentleman there who was the bartender and I couldn't catch his name (probably because he didn't give it t me).  He was pretty slow with his service even though we were the only ones at the bar and the other 2 couples were waiting for their checks.  We waited a good 10 minutes before he asked us what we wanted to drink and a good 30 minutes for our sushi which isn't so bad since we ordered a lot.  When we were ordering the bartender thought it would be funny if he made a joke about his coworkers to me and stated ""They don't speak English."" When I'm pretty sure the Caucasian bartender just spoke English to these sushi chefs to give them our orders.

So it already gave me a bad taste in my mouth that this guy continued with the Asian jokes when I'm clearly Asian and not laughing. 

My sushi wasn't that great as well.  I ordered a sushi roll with the word ""smokey"" in it and so did my friend but of course his was cooked and mine wasn't which tasted different and not satisfying.   I also ordered a spicy tuna in which they gave me a spicy salmon instead. He charged me extra for having my sauce on the side but didn't charge my friends.  Also the soft shell crab doesn't taste fresh or good for that matter.  Even though they cooked it you could taste the frost bite on the soft shell crab roll.

Overall horrible experience with the food and service.. And I just wanted to say that if you decide to work at an Asian restaurant you should probably hold back on the Asian jokes especially when your customer is Asian.","2016-04-06 17:10:54"

I was considering going downtown but Blue Ginger was closer to my hotel and had really good reviews, so I took a chance. I'm so glad because it was awesome! 

The restaurant is tucked away in the back of a rather unassuming strip mall next to a nail salon. I almost drove by it. Once inside, I noticed it was really modern and clean. They did really nice things with the space they had (the restaurant is not really large but they made it seem more spacious than it is). 

I had a seat at the bar and was given a menu right away. Their wine list is not extensive but the wines are decent, good price too, ranging from 6-8$/glass. On Mondays they had half off many rolls so that was nice, some rolls were only $2.50. I decided to get the nigiri because that typically tells you how good a sushi place really is. Now, let me say I typically never eat at ""Asian restaurants"" that serve multiple cuisines, i.e.- Chinese, Japanese, Thai, etc. I think it's hard to do them all because while they do have overlapping elements, each cuisine is an art form of its own. But the pictures and reviews got me in the door.

The nigiri come one piece in an order, most nigiri are cheap on their menu. I think they should raise the price for the quality of what they offer. I got the salmon, yellowtail, and tuna. I also got a spicy California roll and an order of gyoza. The gyoza were cooked perfectly and were handmade. The California roll was well done, the roll was full of ingredients that were all fresh and it didn't fall apart or anything like that. The nigiri- yum! The pieces of fish they use are simply gigantic. Really great quality to the fish too, very fresh, it was cut well, just the right amount of wasabi and the rice was also on point. One of the best nigiri I've had outside of Japan. I was still hungry because I eat a lot so I ordered a dragon roll. It was also delicious. The avocado on top was like butter and the eel inside was very well cooked, soft and flavorful.

Dragon I holds itself in a prime location of being at the heart of State Street where the hustle and bustle takes its hold. When one walks into the restaurant, the lights above strikes a fine balance of illuminating the room with a shroud of mystery. The dark wood complements the table very nicely with the finishing touch of a dark cloth adding to the eeriness and mystery of the restaurant. While upstairs, there's a larger seating accommodating for larger groups of patrons where most other establishments lack.

Beyond the decor and the ambiance, one must inebriate and submit themselves to intoxication of the night before, and with that intoxication, it must carry over to the day of indulging oneself at Dragon I to maximize the experience. This ritual is an absolute must. 

Once browsing the menu, one finds themselves postulating and contemplating while reminiscing the previous dish that they might have regretted or enjoyed previously at Dragon I. I highly stress the importance of still being intoxicated due to the night before to enjoy the high of a rush that the restaurant offers - the grand experience of Russian Roulette when you glance over the wide array of choices in the menu. The thrill of the unknown. The high risk and high reward. You never know what potentially sub-mediocre dish could envelop taste buds and coax them into submission of either distaste or purely the satisfaction of ""it's ok."" This is where Dragon I thrives and the real value that it offers.","2015-12-08 15:35:04"

We arrived on a Monday evening. There were a few patrons, but the place was mostly empty. We were seated promptly. The ambiance is nothing fancy, but everything was clean and casual. I did notice there was still Halloween garland on the pillars.

Our waitress was friendly and offered recommendations when asked. I ordered the pho with meatballs, dumplings, and a milk tea. My dining companion ordered a beer and squid.

When the pho arrived, it came with a small dish of bean sprouts, jalapenos, a lime, and a couple of basil leaves. Usually pho comes with a larger assortment of condiments, but it is not necessary because pho is all about the broth. The broth was tasty, not delicious, not full of the depth of flavors which I associate with pho. It was good, but not great. The slices of beef and the meatballs were all very good, but without those layers of flavor in the broth, it was just disappointing. The dumplings were also tasty, but they reminded me of the dumplings I get from Costco. Nothing special and at well over $1 per dumpling seemed a bit much. I did enjoy the milk tea; creamy, had substance and good flavor. The salt and pepper squid were also fine. Again nothing special, but certainly adequate if a little overcooked.

Every soup I've had here has tasted extremely watered down and I feel like I would be better off just eating instant pho. I've tried a couple of other things that aren't pho including the salt and pepper squid which always seem to be just way too salty. The only thing I've had here that was palatable was the kimchi fried rice, but even that isn't anything special.

This place was on point when it came to flavor of the General Tso's sauce and quality of the chicken.  I did not feel like because of the price ($9.50 for the large order which can easily be split) that the chicken used was of a lesser quality.  In fact, this was one of the few places where they used uniform sized cuts vs some big, some small.

We believed the brown sauce is known as oyster sauce and normally, oyster sauce is used sparingly as most people know it is heavily concentrated. The chef must not have known how salty the sauce is because it was unbearable. If you are contemplating about ordering anything with the brown sauce in the ingredients, make sure to ask for the sauce to be on the side or added lightly.

Value is great, they offer several free items if you purchase certain dollar amounts of food. And you get a lot of food for the price you pay!

Just take one discerning look at your surroundings, and you'll never return. Discovering 100-year-old bits of dried food, bugs, dust, possibly bodily fluids, and duck sauce on every surface from the floor to the ceiling is enough to induce a dry (or wet!) heave. bslkfjasdfbb.

However, I was not prepared for not having a private room with walls and a door. I also was not prepared for having people talking on the other side of the very well-curtained massage room. I'm actually used to having professional massages in a private room with walls and a door, in either total silence, or with soft instrumental background music. My massage therapist, Mickey, spoke almost no English, did not know sign language which I used to teach, but frequently asked me in broken English if I was okay. I learned that the receptionist who is a very charming and very friendly young woman, spoke fluent English, lived in the neighborhood, and could translate for the client. I wish I had known that before my massage. I thought I recognized that the employees on the other side of my curtain, were speaking Mandarin. They were. But I haven't spoken or heard Mandarin since I was 10 years old, 47 years ago. So my Mandarin was very rusty. O.k. Non-existent. 

I used a Groupon,  which I usually do when trying a new massage or hair salon. Sometimes, when you use a Groupon, you  don't get the level of service that you would if you had paid full price. I know this isn't fair, and I know that this is not good customer service, but this is what happens sometimes. It's on the business, not on Groupon. Fortunately, that was not the case with my massage. Mickey was thorough, and really worked my muscles.  I wasn't asked, but  I received a deep tissue massage. That was good for what my issues were, but different massages are beneficial for different issues. So it's always nice when the massage therapist asks what your issues are or what kind of a massage you would prefer. I'll tell you, for one tiny little Asian woman, she spared no expense with eradicating all the tense, stiff, or sore muscles I had. I felt great, but a bit sore. Totally understandable. I went home and took another Epsom salt bath. I drank copious amounts of water for the rest of the day and the next. It's part of my ritual detox following a massage. Before a massage, I drink a cup of green tea with a touch of honey, then a bottle of water, and enjoy an Epsom salt bath by candle light. This routine makes my massages more beneficial.

When I go back, I'll make sure the receptionist tells my masseuse  (I didn't see any men except for one in a parka) what my issues are and the massage I'd like.  I'll also try to book an appointment when it's quiet and not busy, as I like a quiet massage.  I admit, I just lay there like an amoeba during my massage. I usually don't talk unless I'm asked a question. I just lay there, focus on my breathing, and enjoy the experience. And this is a good place to do just that.","2018-12-07 17:33:41"

This place is Awesome with a capital A.
Worth. Every. Single. Penny.
Came here two times so far and will definitely be back many many more.
First time a 90 minute massage (30 min feet,60 min body)
Second time 60 minute foot.
Strong hands and they clearly know what they are doing.
Big comfy chairs for the foot massages they recline so you can lay back and relax.
The full body massage is in a curtained off area next to the chairs.
More than enough privacy.
The sitting up back massage I received before the 60 min foot massage was on point.
Could have had that for an hour alone.
Made my neck feel much better.
Right on Murray Ave which has its up and downs.
Super convenient location
Downside is that the door opens right to the noisy street, so at times you are relaxing and someone walks in and you hear all the buses/cars and people going by.

You can make an appointment right through the yelp app. They respond almost instantaneously. 

Now to the nitty gritty.
I very rarely use Groupon. This was only my second time using it. 
For the 30 min foot/60 min back I had a groupon.
Then I kept getting emails from Groupon prompting that the massage place added new deals.
I probably got 5 or 6 emails in one week promoting the massage place. 
So I was like okay it's my birthday why not get one for me and my mom.
So we purchased two 60min foot massages.
Came in on March 29 (aka my birthday)
Had excellent massages.
Went to pay and showed her the Groupon.
She said we can't use them because it's for first time customers only. 
I'm like okay, I didn't see that.
She pulls out a paper of the Groupon deal and it's apparently in the fine print.
Raise your hand if you ever read the fine print 
No one does. Should we? Of course. But we don't.
So clearly this has happened to other people who go there. 
So i think it's time to take it out of the fine print and move it up to the actual deal description. 

 I asked if I could use my mothers Groupon at least because she didn't use one at our last visit just me.
She said no you have to be first time customers.
Okay whatever, we paid, no problem.
But honestly we are returning customers and clearly we are going to be people who come back many times. 
Better to keep customers happy. 

It was a big hassle with Groupon. 
They wanted to give us credit instead of refunding us. But since I rarely use Groupon a credit would be useless. After sitting on countless holds the Groupon guy finally decided to give us a refund.

And okay, okay I know people hate Groupon they think it makes the person cheap. But if the place doesn't want people to use a Groupon don't have Groupon deals. 
I was just getting bombarded with promotion emails which is why I even purchased it a second time.

Anyhow, massage place is great massage wise.
They just need to fix their Groupon issues.","2019-04-07 16:16:42"

Not so long ago, How Lee's was a down-and-dirty corner joint turning out strictly mediocre Americanized Chinese fare for take-out only. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has been transformed into a sit-down restaurant serving exhilaratingly spicy and flavorful Sichuan dishes.

With two dining partners, I sampled the dan dan noodles, the garlic eggplant, and the Sichuan prawns. The noodles were pleasantly chewy and luxuriously bathed in the sesame-rich sauce studded with bits of ground pork. The eggplant had a tinge of sweetness nicely countered by the sharp garlic and swirls of chili oil. The prawns were dry-fried with several cups of dried chilis. The fresh sweetness of the shrimp balanced perfectly with the saltiness and spice of its seasonings.

The service was friendly and prompt, and our server checked on us several times to make sure we were pleased with our meal and to see if we needed anything further.

The New How Lee is a wonderful addition to the Squirrel Hill food scene and I'd be more than happy to dine there again.","2013-12-28 21:07:45"

First the bad stuff.  There's no menu (in English, anyway) and the experience is not streamlined.  They take your order at the register, but insist that you pay after eating, which feels pretty awkward.  There were little cups for sauces, but no lids, so we had to ask for our takeout order.  After coming back a second time, there was no one who could speak English working so the nice and friendly lady working the register had to ask some customers to play translator.  The place barely looks open and when you walk in you think, ""Am I supposed to be here?""

Good stuff: the dumplings/buns are great and fairly priced.  The interior is pleasant and nicely decorated.  I like the understated nature of the food.  It feels like hearty home-cooking style food.  The dumpling fillings are simple but well-implemented.  Very juicy and flavorful.  

Menu, since it's not currently posted:

Dumplings: $8.50 for ~14
Pork w nappa cabbage
Beef with green onion (really really good)
Beef with carrot

Buns: $1.50 each
Pork w nappa cabbage
Lamb with carrot
Beef with green onion
Beef with carrot

In summary, great food at great prices, but it's currently strange to eat there, especially if you don't know Chinese.  I'm not knocking off any stars for that because I found it kind of charming, but if it sounds like something that would bother you, you might want to wait until they get situated and better figure out their workflow.","2016-12-19 21:15:16"

Went out to eat there with two friends on a Saturday night, waited for 15 minutes, and loved being a minority amongst tables of Asians. Servers were nice and quick. 

Fried scallion pancakes off the American menu were homemade and epic. We had the cucumber salad (don't bother, it was bitter - like when cucumbers have that bitter skin). Beef chow fun was delish, though the beef was unsurprisingly un-beef like (but not gross or gristly). Plenty of tasty egg bits and crunchy onions and other things. On the Sichuan menu, we had the sichuan kung pao chicken with peanuts. It was delish, great sauce. We tripped out on the weird taste in our mouths that made water taste totally bizarre. Then I noticed a clove-sized spice in the sauce, chewed on one and half my mouth did something crazy. We asked our server: ""pickled ash, numbs your mouth."" Sweeeet! I love encountering new shit at a restaurant. I also noted the brilliance of putting in a numbing agent to counter the red chili spice. 

In case you're curious, I Wiki'd pickled ash, and it's PRICKLY ASH. Here's the story: ""The fruit of several species of Zanthoare used to make the spice Sichuan pepper. They are also used as bonsai trees. Historically, the bark was widely used for toothache, colic, and rheumatism.""

Dinner for three was $42 including tip. Goddamn that's cheap!

The portion size was really generous on both. The Pad Thai was a little more saucy than I'm used to and was a different color than I'm accustomed, but it was pretty good and satisfied a craving. The meat was very good. Thinly sliced chicken breast was cooked perfectly. The dish had a pleasant spice level, too.

The Szechuan chicken was also good. Again, great quality meat- no gristle and mystery pieces here! I should have asked about the vegetables that were included because this one had a lot of bell pepper which I don't really care for. That's not their fault, I forgot to ask. There were bamboo shoots and carrots, too. All in all, a good dish. 

I'd definitely go back to try a few other things. They have sushi and a few other Thai offerings, mostly curries.

This is often too spicy for most other people I enjoy dining with.  There are Schezwan peppercorns in this, which make your tongue go slightly numb and feel lemony. So good!  You'll probably feel iffy ordering it, because the name sounds like a bad, racist Rosie O'Donnell joke.

Dined here with the family for pawpaw's birthday. You select your choice of meat and style of broth from the menu. Simple as that. Select any add-ons that you wish. Proceed to the sauce bar in the back of the room and make your concoction. My favorite part is the freshly, crushed garlic. My own recipe goes a little like this: 1 tbsp crushed garlic, 2 tbsps sesame oil, 1 tbsp Mongolian Sauce, and a dash of salt. Just like grandpop used to make! 

There are a bucket of raw eggs to add to your already mounting plate of food and sensory. You can do one of two things, crack it open in your boiling pot, or put the egg with shell in the broth for a hard boiled egg.

Two noodles await your gleaming eyes; mung bean (glass) noodles and yellow lo mein noodles.

The gracious waitress will bring you a plate of veggies containing spam, wienies, fish balls, fried and fresh tofu.

We tried the Korean Kimchi and Sichuan Spicy Broth. There are white peppercorn and dried red chilis in the Sichuan broth, don't attempt unless you're ready to handle the heat. For the tamer palate, lots of plain broth had to be added to ease the burn. As I type this, Sucker for Pain is playing on Pandora, huh. I would say, the Sichuan broth is still not 'ma-la' as you would find in a real hot pot restaurant in Chengdu, but still - pretty authentic.

We chose a broth, and a meat (or you can do just veggies) .  All meats come with a large amount of vegetables as well.

I recommend the Szechuan spicy broth. Unfortunately, the coconut broth is 100% coconut broth and a little shredded coconut, which does not add much flavor to your food. I ameliorated the lack of flavor from coconut broth after cooking by using a small bowl in which I added sauce and some spicy broth. 

Each plate came with a large bed of bok choy and cabbage and lots of other vegetables, some sausages and tofu.  You can pay a la carte for more add ons but honestly I can't imagine doing so because the regular portion is very large. They bring a separate plate with the thinly sliced meat.

Our order for veggie dish, noodle dish, shrimp, chicken dish, pot stickers was over $70 too.  When the delivery lady came she wanted $10, we explained what happened and she said she needed $10 in order to give us the rice.  I asked her what she was going to do with it and she said take it back to the restaurant . . . to reuse in someone else's dish??? IDK, but makes you wonder.  Anyway, needless to say not going back to Rice Inn for the overpriced mediocre food.  Back to the drawing board!","2018-05-30 23:33:56"

That's about the only positive I can come up with.
We placed our takeout order: Large Hot & Sour soup, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Moo Goo Gai Pan and steamed white rice (they don't have brown). When the person taking the order said it would be ready in 10 minutes, I got very nervous and should have respected my instincts.
The only redeemable items were the soup & the rice. The soup was respectable, actually. Nice flavor balance between sour and spicy, loaded with tofu and other veggies. A strange yellow tint to the broth, maybe turmeric. What would turmeric be doing in hot & sour soup? The rice was perfectly steamed.
The Kung Pao chicken was not spicy at all, even though we had requested it to be. The meat was battered and deep fried, which was actually a plus as we discovered by tasting the slimy meat in the other two dishes. Seriously--slimy. Not edible.

I usually do hot pot when I'm with family - so not at a restaurant - but that's in California. This was actually my entire party's (party of 12) experience doing hot pot. I loved the individual hot pots, as did my entire party. We have some picky eaters in my group - vegetarians, lacto-vegetarians, and vegetarians that don't like garlic or onion. Each person was able to choose a broth and food according to their preferences. 

We learned that there are several ways to choose how you want to do your hot pot. The two ways we did was (1) choosing the meat and choosing the broth and (2) choosing a mix of sides and choosing the broth (this likely makes more sense when you order). I chose the Singapore Coconut Broth with the mix of sides. Others chose the Thai broth. One chose just the vegetable broth making sure there was no garlic or onion. The broth, I felt, wasn't wonderfully flavorful, but there was hints of coconut in mine.

Then there's the dipping sauce. You basically have a variety of sauces to choose from with spices to include in it. We were unsure where to start, but then saw there's a dipping sauce that was a ""favorite"" and favorite for a reason. It was AMAZING! Our no-garlic-or-onion vegetarian was having some difficulty making it. The staff not only helped her, but delivered the sauce to her spot at our table when she (our friend) had to excuse herself.

Food (8.5/10) = Dishes I've tried (all from the Sichuan Specialty section of the menu):

Appetizer Section:
1) Dan Dan Noodles = A dish found on most Sichuan menus.  Classic ""street food"" fare.  A noodle dish with minced meat, with a spicy sesame paste based sauce, topped with chopped green onions +/- cilantro, and ground Sichuan peppercorns.  This dish is good, but certainly not the best I've had.  
2) Fu Qi Fei Pian = the English translation of this dish doesn't sound appetizing.  But it's certainly a Sichuan specialty, and one of the dishes I use to judge a Sichuan restaurant.  The dish is served cold and composed of thin slices of various parts of the cow (beef, tripe, tongue, etc.).  The meat is marinated with a spicy oil based sauce, topped with ground Sichuan peppercorns and chopped cilantro.  A great appetizer to try.  Again, the dish is good, but not the best 'fu qi fei pian' I've had in North America.

Vegetable Section:
1) Tu Dou Si = Essentially stir-fried julienned potato.  The dish is done well by the How Lee chefs.  Potatoes are cooked, but still slightly crisp and not soggy.
2) Yu Xiang Qie Zi = look at the picture I posted.  Look how beautiful the eggplant looks.  The glistening purple skin of this fine vegetable.  The sauce is slightly sweet and slightly spicy.  The eggplant is not overdone to the soggy mush texture that sometimes happens at some Chinese restaurants.
3) Kong Xin Cai = Chinese water spinach, or literally 'hollow heart vegetable.'  One of my favorite vegetable dishes to eat.  Lightly stir-fried with green onions and garlic.  Maybe a little ginger?  A clean crisp dish.  It's the vegetable's texture that is unique.  The crunch of biting into a vegetable straw.

Seafood Section:
1) Shui Zhu Yu Pian = This dish is done very well by the chefs of How Lee.  The fish slices are incredibly tender.  The spicy broth that these fish slices swim in is spicy...the level of spiciness where you start sweating.  The glorious physiologic reaction to Sichuan food, while your tongue is numbed out by the Sichuan peppercorns.  Again, the fish slices are big and impressively tender.  At the bottom of the shallow bowl, sits a bed of Napa cabbage.  Sprigs of cilantro sit on top of the dish.  Warning, don't drink the broth, unless you strangely enjoy extracurricular activities such as dropping fireball bombs into porcelain the next morning.

Meat Section:
1) ChongQing La Zi Ji = Chongqing style spicy diced chicken.  Little pieces of diced fried chicken.  It's crispy.  Finished in the wok with red chili peppers, garlic, and sesame seeds.  I can't decide if this is my favorite How Lee dish or the Shui Zu Yu Pian.  Despite how approx 35% of the dish is composed of red chili peppers, the spiciness is not overwhelming.  It' just enough to give each morsel of fried chicken a kick of heat.    

Ambiance (7.5/10) = Cozy and clean.  Situated at the corner of Shady Ave and Forbes.  The decor is what I expect of most Chinese restaurants.

Service (7.5/10) = service is fast.  food comes out fast.  

Overall opinion = Haven't decided if this is the best Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Their menu includes the typical ""American"" Chinese food, but the real gem is the Sichuan menu in the back.  While some of the dishes I've tried were not the best in North America, overall the food is very delicious.  As I've mentioned in other reviews of Pittsburgh Asian restaurants, the prices are higher than what you would find in other cities with a Chinatown or a huge Asian population.  If you've never been to How Lee, I highly recommend trying the Chongqing La Zi Ji and Shui Zhu Yu Pian.","2013-10-27 23:07:19"

All of the vegetables are fresh, the meats are nice and thinly sliced, and there are lots of choices for broth!

I highly recommend choosing your own ""dishes"" instead of choosing their dish bundles. I will recommend the bundles if you are an adventurous eater. The bundle can come with fish balls and other items you may have no interest in. 

My favorite is the Korean Kim Chee broth. It's spicy but not overly spicy. I order beef, puff tofu, enoki mushroom, and spinach. YUM. Just thinking about it is making me drool. Tofu puffs are cubes of spongy tofu (not the white kind you're used to). They take a while to cook, so I normally plop them in and let them soak. 

If you've never had hot pot before, not to worry. Just have fun with your food. Once you mark up what you want, go to the sauce booth.

The food is consistently fresh and delicious. Generous portions as you would expect from Chinese. The egg rolls are the best I've ever had and you can order vegetable ones with no problem.

Over the years they have been expanding their vegetarian menu to include tofu dishes such as Teriakyi tofu, Ma Po Tofu, and General Tsos.  The non-tofu vegetarian dishes have always been very good. My friends and family never complain. My veg faves are the Curry Vegetables, lots of chopped vegetables over a bed of rice noodles in a light curry sauce, and the Hunan vegetables, lots of chopped veggies in a brown hunan sauce with rice. They also also have great pad thai and egg foo young dishes and they have brown rice on the menu!

I can't say enough about the freshness and taste of the dishes compared to other chinese places. You get actual cut vegetables like broccoli, water chestnuts, carrots and bok choy. It's not just a lot of filler vegetables like onions and celery. The fried rice is fluffy not clumpy. The food is prepared to order. Presentation is always great. 

The staff is always very friendly and attentive. 
The prices are average for chinese food with some of the speciality items priced a little higher. 
The place is clean and been redecorated in the last few years.  I took my Grandma Helen here for lunch. She is very picky about freshness and cleanliness and this place passed the test. (She ordered the chow mein and enjoyed it very much).

I'll start with the good:

The food is here is great - I got the Beef and Onion dumplings and they tasted great (a plate of dumplings is $9.81 with tax). I would recommend dipping dumplings in the Chili sauce and eating them.  The interiors are pretty cool and honestly much better than most other stores in Campustown.

The bad:
The service here needs serious work. It seems like most of the staff cannot speak English, and to order, I had to enlist the help of customers who could speak Chinese. There is ""menu"" on the wall made out of wooden placards, but everything is written with Chinese characters. There is no English menu. I get wanting to stick to your ""theme"" of not having English on the walls but what really makes it worse is that your staff cannot help customers order either (because they don't speak English). 

It will take a while for your food to be made because it is prepared fresh. It took almost 30 minutes to get my order. Since I was warned beforehand about how long it would take, I agreed to wait. But service here is really slow and you'll need a Chinese friend (or at least know how to say what you ordered in Chinese) when one of the staff comes out and calls out the dish you ordered.

So it took about 25 minutes total for the food to be ready - kind of a while, but given the crowd I'm not surprised.

We took the food home, and nommed it.  I loved the scallion pancake - they're really simple and I've never had one that was different than any other, but the greasy, crispy consistency keeps me coming back.  Yum!  Fried rice was okay - I've had it better at other places (I think I liked it a lot at Pacific Ring).  My boyfriend really liked the Szechuan dish - it was only a little bit spicy, and the sauce did have the glossy Chinese food consistency, but the taste was pretty good.  Portions were big and lasted us for several meals.

Maybe next time we'll try something a little more adventurous, and hopefully be rewarded with deliciousness!","2011-02-24 16:16:38"

We ordered from Food Fetchers tonight. The pictures on the website and on yelp look so NICE. This definitely seemed like a P.F. Chang's stepchild. Not that I've ever been to P.F. Chang's. But whatever. It seemed nice, and a little unconventional, with several different Asian cuisines available. (I would have liked to have tried the sushi, as I am always on the lookout for good sushi in the Cleve, but I have a strict no-takeout sushi policy. I could explain that, but i won't.)

I ordered my go-to meal I always have when trying a new place, for the comparison factor : wonton soup and chicken with broccoli. Bo-ring!

The soup gets a 2.5. There was tons of crap in it, and unnecessary crap at that. I don't want greens in my soup! Was it seaweed? Or kale? I dunno. There were too many scallions. The broth wasn't flavorful enough. The meat in the wontons was weird. Etc.

However, the chicken with broccoli gets a 5! Delicious and plentiful. It had white sauce, but no carrots or water chestnuts (gag!), for which I was thankful. Also, the rice was steamed perfectly. No hard and crunchy rice here.

My husband had lettuce wraps, which LOOKED dumb (iceberg? Really?) but tasted GREAT! And he also had a really healthy and good looking salad, the jerk. Making me feel bad about myself.

All in all, very good! Very fresh tasting, not greasy in the least. It seemed....what?!...healthy. I'll take it.","2011-01-18 02:13:34"

Do you enjoy spicy broth and eating discrete items? Would you like a nice hot meal on a cold rainy day? Are you a naturally slow eater and wish your meal would stay hot at your leisure? Ever had the unique experience of slurping piping hot noodle soup to sweat out an even hotter summer? If these things apply to you...do I need to tell you to read on? 

For those new to hot pot, aka shabu shabu, aka Chinese fondue, it might seem scary at first. There is no compromise here at Mini Hot Pot, although the servers are kind and willing to help. The one nontraditional aspect that stands out is you get your own personal pot instead of a family-style cauldron, but personal pots are more in vogue these days. All you need is to embrace your inner capitalist and individualist!!

I recommend getting one of the set meals. You can always come back and order items a la carte, but it's just simpler if you haven't been here before. There's a range of options including seafood and vegetarian, but if you're omnivore go with beef or pork. Select the broth you want -- the Szechuan is not for the weak (""spicy numb"" hot). As you're waiting for your ingredients to arrive, head over to the self serve station to create your own dipping sauce. Everyone has their own way; for me, I go with half a ladle each of sesame paste and Taiwanese bbq sauce, a dab of hoisin, a pinch of cilantro and green onion, a splash of soy sauce and vinegar, and a few dribbles of sesame oil. You'll figure it out. Pick up an empty plate too, and head back to your seat. 

Hot pot is all about timing. Once your plate of goodies arrive, put in the heartier looking stuff like the corn, tofu, nappa cabbage, fish cakes, and mini hotdogs. The extra plate you have serves as a holding station for goodies freshly pulled from the broth, to cool off before eating, or to avoid overcooking. Stuff you want to be careful about leaving in the pot too long include: spinach, imitation crab leg, vermicelli, and those ribbons of beef or pork you ordered.     

When done cooking, dip your items into your sauce and enjoy. For those leveling up on sauce, bring a raw egg from the self serve station back to your seat, and using the two halves of your cracked egg shell, separate the egg white into your boiling pot for eating later. Plop the yolk into your sauce dish, and stir.

If your soup boils down and gets too salty, ask the servers for more broth. Don't forget the noodle bar, which is part of the set meal. They have rice noodles, vermicelli (sweet potato), and udon (wheat). This step is key for people who don't get full easily. Pile some onto a plate, dunk in broth and enjoy. Finally, in true Chinese tradition, top your meal off with some fresh fruit, it was strawberries the day I went, and voila! Mini Hot Pot experience accomplished.","2016-01-09 03:06:09"

"o6FSzXrpaZFqdmfpzotV4Q","R6a_3dRlJI6n_yX2eToxuw","VUDwlypqw1-DTK_lfEP4jg",2,4,0,0,"Formerly known as Eastern Chinese Buffet, this establishment closed for a month or so during the summer of '14 and reopened as Panda Buffet. I had always planned on going when it was Eastern Chinese Buffet, but never made it, as China Buffet King over in Green Tree always got my vote. However, the other night I was out and about with the full intention of trying it as the newly re-christened Panda Buffet.

It was a pretty underwhelming experience. I went between 7 and 8 PM and was the only person in there the majority of the time. When I was nearly finished, another person came in for some take out. There is adequate room for a good number of diners in there, but perhaps I just went during a less busy night.

The buffet is comprised of three main tables, with a fourth one scuttled off to the side. The first table had the standard fruit and dessert items. Cakes, cookies, slices of watermelon, you know the stuff. The second and third tables had the various soups and Chinese dishes, as well as the substandard American fare that plagues too many Chinese buffets. The fourth table had a sad little tray of crab legs and a couple of other items that didn't look too appetizing.

It's a pretty rinky-dink selection. I tried the wonton soup first. It was decent. The wontons were small, and the broth had decent flavor, which is more than I can say for Phong May House's wonton soup (see the review for that place for those details), I liked it enough to go back for a second bowl, but that may have also been down to the slim selection on the buffet overall.

The coconut shrimp was very good. Nice and tangy, with no fishy taste, which is always a plus at a buffet. I also enjoyed the steamed dumplings. The filling seemed to be different from the usual potsticker recipe. I couldn't tell if it was chicken, pork, or a mix of the two. Weird stuff, but another thing I had seconds of.

The General Tso's chicken's sauce is way too thick. It was similar to a thick barbecue sauce. I didn't care for it. Ditto on the egg rolls. The pork filling in them was that strange sort of minced/spiced variety. Way too overpowering. I didn't try the spring rolls, but they didn't look much better.

A big problem overall was trying to determine how long all the food on the buffet had been out. A person came out of the back and refilled the fried rice once. Nothing else was refreshed or refilled the rest of the time I was there, even though I had claimed the last of the dumplings and most of the wontons (there were four before I got my soup). The rest of the items had a sort of glazed over look to them, especially the sweet and sour sauce which looked like it may have darkened and almost got a skin going on top. Yeah. Not so great.

I doubt I'll ever go back.It's definitely cheaper by a couple bucks than China Buffet King, but the food isn't in the same class, even though it's buffet fare. The two or three things I enjoyed were decent enough, but nothing to get me to come back for those alone. Maybe some people really dig this place, but if my visit was any indication of a regular experience there, I wouldn't be surprised if Panda Buffet winds up closing as well.","2014-09-15 17:20:48"

The twice cooked pork belly with capsaicin is still good, and my favorite dish at the restaurant.  We tried the chongqing chicken, but it was so oily and OVERLY peppery (yes, I know it's Sichuan food but this was over the top) that it was too much.

The best thing that How Lee does is the salt and pepper shrimp (sichuan style).  The sichuan peppercorns are ground up and put into the batter and the result is delicious and numbing.

I'm still hopeful that How Lee will make a valiant comeback.  It's still 3 stars, but with a bit more attention to detail they could be 4-5.

The egg plant with a garlic sauce is tasty and not spicy - this will be welcome if some around your table are sensitive to spices.

Everybody, including the customers, is speaking Mandarin, and that forces me to communicate with the cashier rather than just read off of a boring English menu.

You can do the HotPot or you can order off the menu ""regular"" Chinese food.   

I chose the HotPot and probably will do so again.  You pick your protein, you go up to the buffet table and pick what veggies& noodles (they have several variety of noodles)  and then create the sauce - there is a handy guide to help and the staff is more than willing to create the sauce for you while teaching along the way. You then head back to the table and it cooks right in front of you/ tastes were amazing and since you vary what's in the sauce and what protein/veggies and noodles - its a bit different each time. I found myself going back to the buffet to gather more noodles and veggies - it was so good.

I did not rate 5 stars just because the menu is a bit confusing and we had to ask a bunch of questions to figure out how to move forward.

Looked after being seated and realized all the other patrons were hipster-nerdy asian college students. Not kidding. We joked that we must be in the right place. 

Everyone has already put up enough pictures of the hot dishes--I'll simply agree that it was hot, authentic-tasting, and hits the spot. 

My contribution will be a note on the Xihu Niu Rou Gen (we were all glad to order that--for those who weren't prepared for how hot the spicy food was--it was a lifesaver for sure), which is a clear and starchy beef soup. Chinese watercress was also great (I was delighted they still had  this in late November, usually it's out of season by late August/September). It tasted very good, but they didn't cut up the stems much.

It gets a stamp of approval though, and is a reliable choice for real, spicy Sichuan style food of the ""ma la"" variety. One thing they could've improved was to refill the water more frequently. I mean, if your food is going to be burning up our mouths...we need some relief! (To be fair, business was great, so I could understand the waitresses were quite busy.)","2014-07-02 16:17:23"

Since I don't eat Baby Boomer Chinese food (Sweet and Sour pork eaters, I'm talking to you) this review is totally separate from their ""not chinese"" menu. I only eat from the Szechaun menu

Is it ""phoenominal"" chinese cuisine? Hard to say. I think overall it is great; but this is coming from a Pittsburgh-centric view on Chinese food. You will have better Chinese food in China (obv) and I guess I've had better...but consistency is worth noting at New How Lee.  Try the potatoes and green chiles, and if you ask nicely you can have these dishes made with a tofu substitute, though it isn't advertised. They also get Tiger Peppers, which are extremely hot (or tolerably hot..season dependent) and spicy food eaters would relish in the chance to eat these. They are intensely enjoyable.

I saw another review representing China Star on McKnight and I'd agree it is an excellent place but it's a tough call overall-saying one is entirely better than the other isn't something I'd stake money on at this point. Though the China Star menu is formidable, I wouldn't call NHL's (just figured out that acronym...) menu weak by any means. You can get a hot pot oil styled fish platter that will throw you off; t permeates with Szechuan peppercorn and is absolutely coated in grease. However, spooning it out onto rice gives the intended result and ¨ª'd dare a true food enthusiast not to enjoy it. There are food options/styles here that aren't seen in 90% of PGH Chinese restaurants and I think that percentage is a low estimate.

What once was a cliche Chino'merican establishment has genuinely changed...just don't look at the ""normal"" menu.","2013-03-03 07:16:50"

Wasn't a huge fan of the Chonqing chicken dumplings appetizer, but the dan dan noodles are a must.   I also appreciated that they didn't automatically dumb-down the Sichuan dishes just because we were white (i.e. not use Sichuan peppercorns).

First impression left me feeling a little nervous about the food. The place looks to have been recently renovated, but nothing fancy. After being sat and ordered off of the extensive menu, the server gave us some small plates and wine glasses. A few of the wine glasses had a ""film"" on them that I cannot pinpoint the source of. And then a few of the plates still had a little ""crust"" stuck to them. The server was happy to exchange these items out for cleaner ones. Not a good start, but the order had already been placed so I was going to give this place a shot whether I wanted to or not.

DRINKS
- BYOB

APPETIZERS
- Steamed pork dumplings. These were so-so.

MAINS
- Tiger Skin Peppers. Wow - these are delicious, but incredibly spicy! Being someone who loves spice, I was even a little nervous to dive into this dish after tasting the first bite. Others at the table literally had tears dripping down their faces. Folks, any pepper can range in spice level -- order with caution.
- Spicy eggplant. I'm not even an eggplant fan, and this dish was really good.
- Mapo tofu (ordered with no pork) -- aka the Szechuan tofu. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.
- Others at my table ordered the spicy prawns, chili beef, and some spicy chicken dish. They all enjoyed these dishes, but probably the chicken and beef ones more than the prawns.

OVERALL
I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I wish they would double-check their plates and glassware before setting it out, but as far as the food is concerned, it was a good experience.

I will definitely give How Lee a shot again in the future.","2017-11-12 15:52:48"

Crispy breaded chicken, tangy, sweet, and slightly spicy sauce, a couple of pieces of fresh broccoli thrown in for good measure...General Tso's, you please me so.

I don't live in Squirrel Hill anymore, but when I did, their delivery speed was always stellar. Now I do mostly takeout, and even during their busiest times, they always have my order ready when they say they will.

Bonus points: They let you sub brown rice for white for a small upcharge, which helps trick me into thinking that my meal is not going straight into my arteries (but who are we kidding, it totally is).

Spicy tofu (Mapo-Doufu) is a must-get. Very soft so it can be challenging to pick up with chopsticks even for those who use them daily. But the taste... It is just perfect. And you will know what I mean if you have tried it. Lamb, fish and pork are all very good. I am not into beef but their spicy beef is also appealing to me. But before you order, make sure you are ready for the spiciness by asking for extra napkins and constant water refill.

Besides the famous mini Hotpot here(a lot of people already recommend before). You could also order Chinese dishes and some traditional Chinese entrees. Lunch special M-F is a great deal. You will have two dishes(usually one meat and one vegetable) rice and tea egg cost $10.00 before tax and tip. 
The dishes are more likely homemade styles instead of the too salty and oil Chinese food in other restaurants. The dumplings here are homemade style instead of frozen ones in some restaurant. Beef roll cake is a nice option as well. 
I highly recommend that you try the Chinese Chives pie or Chinese leek box though you maybe need to wait a little longer time after ordering. But they are very yummy. Also availability about that depends on the leek.

There's a great Sichuan menu, and the Americanized menu is similarly good. Many Americanized menus use a heavy hand with sauces, sometimes to disguise the poor quality of the ingredients.

(A little history about the place most people don't know or remember: Back in 1993 someone opened a local Chinese take out chain called, not kidding, Ho Lee Chow. Get it? Holy Cow - Ho Lee Chow? It was greeted with as much enthusiasm as you'd expect from a joke name. While the rest of the chain closed, someone bought the one location in Squirrel Hill, eliminated the word ""Chow,"" but took the ""w""  and stuck it at the end of ""Ho."" That's where their name came from. They've been there ever since.)

So tonight was my first experience with them. I contacted them for delivery through Grub Hub (look it up - good service!).

The menu itself was a little light on explanation - just names of the dishes with nothing to say what was included in them. But the amount of selections was pretty impressive. Even as a vegetarian, I had a lot to choose from. I decided to go with Tofu Home Style - a tried and true favorite from other places since I wasn't in the mood for experimenting.

The service gave an estimated hour for delivery. Less than thirty minutes later, they were ringing my bell! Thumbs up for *super* fast delivery!

The temperature of the food was right out of the wok *hot*! I've never had delivery that I had to blow on and wait a few minutes before I could eat it. (It probably helped that I'm only about a mile away, but I give them the points anyway.)

The spring rolls were crunchy and delicious - not too greasy and really packed full. Highly recommended!

I asked for, and got, some broccoli in the dish - Tofu Home Style almost never comes with it - and they were generous too. The tofu was nice and firm - I know it's not good for me, but I *really* like my tofu deep fried, and it was *very* tasty. The vegetables were all nice and firm, in fact. Nothing soggy or over cooked at all.

If I had to make one criticism, it would be the ratio of tofu to vegetables. I like a few more veggies and a little less of the tofu chunks. But for a first order, I was pretty happy.  

Next time I'll experiment with an unknown, but for something I like and can be picky about, they did well and now have a new customer.","2012-07-08 02:31:47"

A few advice to the restaurant: 
1. The restaurant sign could be bigger or more obvious - me as a first-time customer, it took a while for me to find the restaurant and door entrance.
2. There should be at least one person staying in the lounge and greeting customers. The first time I stepped in, I was wandering around and not sure if I should find a seat myself OR to be seated.

We've lived in Madison for almost three decades and feel we are pretty in-tune with the comings and goings of restaurants, including Asian restaurants.  But it was only because of Yelp that I stumbled upon reviews for Mini Hot Pot  last night.  A big ""thank you"" to our Yelp brothers and sisters for the introduction and knowledge of this place that fills a major hole in our ethnic food scene.  

Now, I will try to do my part and share our experience at lunch just moments ago.  

UPSHOT--run, don't walk, and give them a go, particularly for lunch!  (But no running with scissors. You'll poke your eye out).

Here's the set up:  Me--Asian-American born and raised in Hawaii who loves spice, and trying new things. I have always wanted to try a hot pot, seeing it on various travel and food shows.  Wifey--pure Wisconsin white girl whose only experience with Asian food before meeting me was La Choy chow mein from a can and Wong's--""would you like brown gravy on your rice?""--Wok.  She has decidely more conservative tastes, disliking spicy food, seafood, mushrooms, and other items towards that end of the food spectrum.

But Mini Hot Pot hit the spot for both of us!

The space is modestly sized, seating maybe 25-35 (?) people at various sized tables. All of the tables have cooking burners built into them for diner use.  There is adequate parking and the restaurant is neat and clean.  

I've seen it many times on television but this is my first experience with hot pot dining.  Here, you pick the type of broth you'd like and level of spiciness.  They have six types of broth including Szechuan, Thai, mushroom base and tomato base.  There are four levels of spiciness.

Wifey and I had the Szechuan. Of the four spicy tiers, I had the second hottest; She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed, the one beneath to account for her more fragile disposition.  Each found our broths very tasty and complex. Watching them come to a rolling boil before us was also way cool.

By the way, service is very prompt and helpful. Such a nice lady who, along with her husband, own and operate the restaurant. 

Shortly after bringing out your soup pots, you are brought a plate of the meat selection you have made. One plate of beef and one plate of chicken was for us. Each was over flowing with a wide selection of vegetables and other items to cook in the hot pots. Cabbage, some other type of greens, mushrooms, Chinese sausage, mussels, Korean rice cake, tofu, spam (yes, Spam), meatballs, etc. There was more.  Thumbs way up for the slice of spam, by the way. Shout out to my home State!

There is also a self serve station where they have vermicelli, Vietnamese rice noodles, and ramen noodles for you to enjoy as much as you like in your hot pot. This is along  with a host of other add-ins like minced ginger, scallions, cilantro, soy sauce, plum sauce, and many other seasonings at the station.  If you cannot find a taste combination to suit you here, there is nothing on this earth that will satisfy you. We can't be friends. 

The procedure is to bring your hot pot up to a boil and then add whatever you like according to whatever timing you see fit. Sheer awesomeness and fun.  To me, the broth flavor continued to pleasantly morph as my ingredients simmered happily away.   Surprise, surprise. 

The nice lady shows you how to operate your hot plate which is easy to control and very responsive.  

We also had a bubble tea, of which there is only one variety on the menu. Get it. The nice lady said she makes it herself and I think it is a blend of milk, tea and tapioca beads.  The flavor is subtle, sublime, slightly sweet, very soothing and nice to have along with your hot hot pot.  It complements a hot pot most excellently. 

Spouse could not finish her mountain of food and the nice lady thoughtfully brought containers for the leftovers and negotiated them into it herself. Thanks!

The price is so modest for lunch. For two giant pots and mountains of food and a bubble tea, $21 and change, exclusive of tax and tip.  

This great little place is worth a visit and frequenting. I encourage everyone to try them and support their small business which clearly cares about what they are doing and each guest's experience and happiness. Sharing and spreading the news of small business is such an important part of my Yelp experience. I hope it is for you, too. 

Word of caution though - - the soup pots can get very hot so caution is highly encouraged, particularly with the little ones.  

With that in mind, if you are hungry, want something different, delicious, varied, and modestly priced in a clean, friendly, welcoming and non-threatening  environment, go. Go now.  Life is short. Our meals and breaking bread together are limited. We're burning daylight.  See you there. Yelp on.","2016-03-11 20:21:06"

We live less than 1.5 miles away and called early (not during the typical dinner-time rush) but the delivery took a bit longer than 30 minutes.  The total was $29.80 before tip, which seems a bit pricey.

The food was just mediocre.  The cheese wontons were okay but the cheese tasted just a bit off.  The tofu homestyle was bland and the sauce had an odd aftertaste.  The only vegetables were carrots, snow peas, and a few small pieces of bamboo, none of which were flavorful.  The Gold Sesame Chicken is described as having a ""sophisticated brown sauce"", but really it was either General Tso's or sweet and sour sauce.

Mini Hot Pot ROCKS! First time get one of the combi plates, maybe even your second time. If there are lots of people, get a couple of different combi plates and broths and share. There's tons of food and more at the buffet. That's where you'll find  multiple noodles to cook quickly (3min) in the broth. There's a recipe for a basic sauce on the wall near the buffet but feel free to experiment. Try rice noodles (thick and thin), egg noodles, ramen noodles, even a slice of sweet potato. Every time you come, it'll be different. This is improvisational Jazz-cooking, Chinese style!.

My girlfriend and I ordered 2 waters which had a metallic taste to it. Then I ordered a green tea martini, which they said that they were unable to make due to the fact that ""nobody liked it"" so they got rid of the green tea liquor. We then ordered 3 sushi rolls for half off sushi night. Once they came out, we each tried a piece of the shrimp tempura roll. The shrimp tasted like it was fried last week due to the fact that it was hard as a rock. We then tried the eel which was entirely skin and no meat. We also both noticed that nothing was very cold. It was all at room temperature, the rice tasted old, and the seafood had a bad aroma to it. After 20 minutes our server finally came over and we told her that everything was inedible. She said ""Okay"" and took our plates away. After waiting 10 more minutes, we got 2 fortune cookies.  The manager never stopped over and apologized, and neither did the server. I will never be returning.","2016-08-10 00:39:06"

Szechuan Menu
-The baby bak choy was sauteed to perfection with garlic oil. It wasn't over done or under cook. 
-The green beans was sauteed in garlic and pork, giving the dish a nice crunch and caramelized taste.
-The tri-pepper chicken was soo good and soo spicy. If you're not a spicy food fan, then please do not order this. The spice kicks in about 30 seconds later.  So prepare yourself! Eat this with rice to help ease the spiciness. The chicken was also sauteed to perfection. Unlike some places, it was not over done and you can still bite into juicy goodness.

American-Chinese Menu
-Fried rice was okay. Taste like any fried rice.
-Sesame Chicken was actually good! It was flavored well and juicy.

I'll admit I'm pretty picky about Asian food and there's nothing worse than being disappointed! I was hesitant to try Rice Inn because I already had a go to Chinese place, but many friends liked it and I was craving Pad Thai and they had a lunch special that included Pad Thai. I threw caution to the wind and went for it one afternoon for lunch. I ordered both Pad Thai with chicken and a Szechuan Chicken with steamed rice so my dining partner and I could try a little each. 

The portion size was really generous on both. The Pad Thai was a little more saucy than I'm used to and was a different color than I'm accustomed, but it was pretty good and satisfied a craving. The meat was very good. Thinly sliced chicken breast was cooked perfectly. The dish had a pleasant spice level, too. I could have used a little more bean sprouts in the dish, but the snow peas were an interesting addition. 

The Szechuan chicken was also good. Again, great quality meat- no gristle and mystery pieces here! I should have asked about the vegetables that were included because this one had a lot of bell pepper which I don't really care for. That's not their fault, I forgot to ask. There were bamboo shoots and carrots, too. All in all, a good dish. 

I'd definitely go back to try a few other things. They have sushi and a few other Thai offerings, mostly curries.

I guess they must either have a very cheap rent or make a killing on their delivery.

Now, on to the food.  It's actually pretty good asian for Pittsburgh.  You can get very spicy food if you want it, something that I've had problems with in Pittsburgh.  It's generally well prepared, but pretty poor presentation. The take it is, well, take out.  It's a little pricey, but very convenient for folks in Greenfield.

After you order, most definitely hit up the salsa bar to mix your own hot pot sauce (very authentic). I personally recommend using the Taiwanese bbq sauce as your base, since it's very authentic and it's what we did at home in Taiwan.

How Lee was my first stop on my visit to Pittsburgh. I ordered the spicy fish fillets (Shui Zhu Yu), an iconic Sichuan dish, and a cucumber salad, a common cold dish hard to mess up. The cucumber salad was the weirdest version I've ever had, the dressing resembled a green paste made of chives(?). The Shui Zhu Yu was not authentic at all. The sauce was so pasty and the fish was covered in peppers - NOT the Sichuan technique of ""Shui Zhu"".

The Sichuan menu is pretty robust, and while I can't help but order dry fried chicken, I really love the mala, the cumin beef and the fish. There are a few things I've yet to try, but it will happen.

My issue with this 'chinese' restaurant stems from the fact that 'Chow Mein' supposedly means 'rice with tasteless white sauce'! 'Chow Fun' also supposedly means 'skinny, burnt egg noodle'! Correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure that 'mein' means noodle in chinese!
When Ingrid and I ordered food from this restaurant, through the beloved Campusfood.com, our order was intentionally replaced with revolting rice and egg noodles! We were insulted! and hurt! and offended! We were in disbelief when Ingrid called the restaurant to settle the manner, when to our wondering ears did appear, but ignorance and incompetence! The woman argued with her about how WE made a mistake, that 'chow mein' means 'rice and white sauce', which we fervently argued against. We brought forward a witness who spoke fluent cantonese, mandarin, shanghainese, etc.
After discussing the issue, and proving that mein actuality MEANS NOODLE, she refused to give us a refund or deliver the correct order.

2 nights ago on dreaded Black Friday, Kay and I were driving along cozy Library Road aimlessly when I suddenly remembered that relatively recent development and charged forward. 

Like Bigfoot, Kay didn't believe it existed.

""It used to be a Pizza Hut?"" she asked with the tone of a skeptical police officer interrogating a UFO eyewitness. 

""Yes! Keep going! It's there! It's there! I know I saw it! I read reviews on Yelp,"" I replied.

""What's the name again?"" she inquired. 

""Rice Inn.""

""Ricin? Eeeeww. That's a poison!""

""Oh, stop.""

""Well, they at least better be open or else...it's a date with The Redhead,"" Kay coldly promised. 

Sure enough at 8PM on a weekend, Rice Inn's doors were unlocked. The interiors are sparse but tasteful with vibrant, upside down glasses housing the light bulbs. Bourdain's new CNN program was running on a flatscreen telly near a sushi bar. 

A complimentary serving of Edamame was the precursor to our supper. Salted and bulbous, I'd never had these soybeans served to me in this manner before. At first I ate them whole! That is until I realized that I had better tasting results when I popped open each pod to get at the nutty, wholesome beans within. 

I officially began my journey into the inexplicable with a pair of Uni or Sushi with Sea Urchin for the novices among thee. The quivering, ornately presented cylinders of seaweed, rice, and a paste-like roe were bedecked with fanned cucumber. When placed whole in my mouth, what I tasted amidst each opulent morsel's inherently sensual texture were the faint whispers of caviar, foie gras, oyster, and thus...the ocean. This wasn't an appetizer; this was a seduction. The glob of wasabi remained untouched, but the flower of shaved, pickled ginger (I've a soft spot for it) I ate only after I finished the sushi. 

6 swelling, humongous fried pork dumplings came next. Abundant with ground meat filling and golden brown on the outside, had I not shared them with Kay, I could have made them my entree. The balls of savory minced pig stayed within each potsticker, which required knife, fork, and at least two bites to consume wholly. In all seriousness, Rice Inn's dumplings are the largest specimen of this perennial Chinese favorite I've ever experienced, and they alone make a trek to the far South Hills worthwhile. 

Based solely on its fanciful, poetic name, I chose a main dish that fell under the Thai heading. Dancing Seafood Supreme was composed of jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, crabmeat, tomatoes, onion, peppers, carrot, basil, and ""chef's special spicy Thai chili sauce"" as stated in the pamphlet I took home. The sauce was only warmly spicy and never overthrew the majesty that was the pleasingly plump and abundant bits of crustacean and mollusk.

We arrived right when they opened at 11 and they were able to accommodate our large party; otherwise it can get pretty crowded. All of us ordered the lunch hot pot special. You can choose from a non-spicy mushroom broth or a spicy Szechuan broth. Each person has their own hot pot and burner. You select a protein (chicken, lamb, beef or pork) and it comes with a giant plate of veggies and other goodies (fish balls, rice cake, tofu, enoki mushroom, etc). You only get about 6 slices of meat but it's more than enough. I think I was the only one who finished their whole plate. In addition to the meat and veggies, you can get unlimited noodles (there are 3 different kinds) to cook in your broth. There is also a condiment bar where you can make your own custom dipping sauce. All of this came to $9.95/person. It's a really great deal for lunch, plus cooking your own food is kind of fun!","2016-03-02 22:31:10"

The dumplings, both fried and steamed, are awesome and their wonton soup is the best I've had. 

Their chicken lo mein has a good flavor but is so overwhelmingly greasy I find it hard to eat. And their egg rolls are honestly the worst I've ever had and too heavy of a hand on the pepper.

Don't be fooled by the looks for there's not much of an interior design. However, the service is warm, generous and attentive. It outshines its fondue/shabu shabu competitors by allowing each diner his own mini-pot and a buffet selection to make your own sauces. You'll never grudge over compromising your selection of broth or meat out of consideration for your dining partner(s). This format also helps to eliminate cross contamination and flavor mixes. I, for one, cannot stand lamb, so the awkwardness surrounding lamb when ordering in group settings has always been exhausting. They have the solution! 

You may order combination platter or a la cart. The combination platter comes with your choice of protein, then veggies and assortment of treats as sides. This option is priced at $11.95 and $15.95 for lunch and dinner, respectively. A variety of cooking broth styles is also included in the price. Please see the attached picture. A la cart prices range from $1.95 to $4.95. My suggestion is to go with the combination platter, since it comes with a lot of the a la cart stuff. 

There's also a small buffet which comprises a plethora of spices and sauces for you to mix and match, as well as extra noodles, veggies and proteins at no additional cost. 

Overall, I think this concept is clever, unique and fun. The service is always warm and inviting; the food is extremely satisfying, and i sincerely hope that they do well.","2017-01-31 02:54:16"

The food is usually clean and fresh, which can be an issue with other Chinese restaurant. 


CONS:
The restaurant is so tiny! There is usually a line during weekends and the restaurant is tightly packed. The tables are too close to each other that sometimes it can get a little uncomfortable. The whole place is just very crowded in general. Not a great place for a quiet date night.

Our party of 4 was seated immediately around 6 on a Sunday night, despite the restaurant being relatively full already upon our arrival.  Our server came by to take our orders and drop off our dishware and food, and we didn't see her after that until she delivered our single check for the table.  Though I wasn't overly surprised at this level of service, it was a bit minimal even for the typical Pittsburgh Chinese restaurant, and my empty teacup was sad because of it.

We ordered the DAN DAN NOODLES, TOFU VEGETABLE SOUP, BRAISED TOFU, SICHUAN STYLE TOFU WITH MINCED PORK, and CHONGQING FRIED DRIED HOT CHICKEN.  Portions were super generous, and this ended up being way too much food for us, as we took most of both tofu dishes home and left the soup on the table.

So, this soup.  I wasn't expecting a masterpiece.  Typically, I just love having a bowl of soup with pretty much any meal.  Super comforting.  But this soup was pretty disappointing--literally the blandest bowl of soup I've ever ordered at any restaurant ever.  Like, I know it's veggie soup, but I had a veggie broth in a pho just last weekend that pretty much knocked my thigh-highs off, so I definitely don't view meatlessness as an excuse for lack of flavor.  This soup was tragically not even seasoned with salt, so I picked some of the veggies out of the (largely portioned, at least) bowl and left all of the sad, sad broth.  I hate wasting food, and it's almost unprecedented for me to not take home my leftovers.  So today was a sad day in my personal history.

I was really excited to try the braised tofu, and this was the one dish that did not disappoint. The soft and luscious tofu, drenched in a flavorful sauce, reminded me of wonderful braised tofu (dou fu nao) Chinese breakfasts my grandma made me growing up, also this tofu was a bit firmer in comparison (only because legit dou fu nao is like flan consistency).  I wish there had been more mushrooms and bamboo slices included, but still, this dish satisfied my expectations.

I feel that any mapo tofu has pretty big shoes to fill, as this is such an iconic dish, and this iteration, while definitely not one of the best I've had, at least somewhat scratched my itch.  There was a good amount of ""ma,"" but it could have been vastly improved with a bit more bean paste for funk, as well as a topping of scallions, which usually add such a fresh bite to this dish.  There were also literally 3 tiny pieces of leek in there, which, to an allium lover, was such a tease.  I don't normally expect leeks in my mapo tofu, but if you're going to do it, do it right, ya know?  Same with the minced pork--I actually prefer a vegetarian mapo tofu, but if you're going to make a porky version, be generous with the piggyness.

The chongqing chicken was found to be pretty disappointing by our whole table.  For a dish that's as hyped up as it is from this place, it entirely underwhelmed us with its tiny pieces of heavily breaded chicken that tasted mostly (and weirdly) of a fishy flavor.  Our 2 fellas at the table picked at it until it was mostly finished (because fried chicken equals man food, apparently, rawr) but it just definitely less awesome than we were expecting.  Like, a lot less awesome.

So I probably won't choose to come back to How Lee's, what with better options in Pittsburgh, but I wouldn't cry about it if someone felt the need to drag me back here either.   Perhaps they were having an off night, or we just didn't order the right things.  However, the options, especially for vegetarians, were simply lacking compared to other Sichuan restos around here.  So, my search for the best Sichuan in Pittsburgh continues.","2016-08-22 00:37:54"

The tofu was so watery- it had not been pressed, it has not been fried, it had just been cut and put on my plate.  It had not even been seasoned.  It was just soy mush. BEFORE I was going to break my own rule, I asked each person at my table familar with the dish from other places to try it.  ALL OF THEM said it was wrong, gross, cold, horrible.  So I finally asked the lady if they could help me.  THE OWNER YELLED AT ME.  ""It is fried, that is fried"" I said, I am sorry but it is cold. She said fine I will take it and cook it better.  I know better then to have someone threaten me and then give them food to give back to me.  I actually don't believe people spit on food, but for the first time in my life- I didn't trust my waiter or the owner.  She was mean, and rude.  So she said- what do i want then? I guess you want some free food then! SHE SAID THAT TO ME- No i already paid for that, so I want something to eat.  Nothing has been free.  She handed me a menu and hovered over me for the entire time, and finally in a rush I just picked an appetizer.  Because I had already picked what i wanted, but it was horrible.

I do not recommend ordering additional noodles, as in the different kinds of noodles they offer on their menu. They give you a negligible amount, and there's already vermicelli in the buffet station.

We weren't wrong! I'm so glad we tried How Lee. Their specialty is Szechuan food. We tried a little bit of everything but they also appeal to anyone who wants ""regular"" Chinese, as well. 

We started with the Dan Dan noodles and scallion pancake. The Dan Dan noodles weren't as spicy as I thought they would be, which was good for me because too spicy isn't a favorite. The noodles were silky and had great texture. I also enjoyed the pancake, as it wasn't heavy, it was crispy and light. 

We ordered the green beans, tofu chili pot and the twice cooked pork belly with veg. All of the dishes were tasty and it was a different kind of taste, one that I have never had before because all of the Chinese I've had is very Americanized. The waitress actually took the time to show us the chili's and peppercorns used in the dishes, so the service was great!

Growing up in East Central Wisconsin, I wasn't exposed to decent Asian food in the wayward days of my youth.  My memories of this cuisine sadly consist primarily of overcooked veggies in gloppy brown sauce.  As a result, I tended to shy away from Asian food in my college and young professional days.  However, after recently taking a job on Madison's south side, I've enjoyed a Renaissance of sorts as I've enjoyed the vibrant flavors of dishes from Ichiban, Orient House and recently SoHo Gourmet Cuisine during my lunchtime forays.  But I really didn't experience Asian comfort food until my recent visit to Mini Hot Pot.  Maybe it was the fact I came in soaked from a mid-November rain, maybe it was because I didn't eat much breakfast during my early morning meeting, but my Spicy Pork Bowl was as a soul soothing dish I've consumed in recent memory.

Mini Hot Pot sits in an unpretentious Park Street strip mall next to the Copp's grocery store.  I was immediately greeted by the owner as I entered the restaurant and he expeditiously escorted me to an open table.  The interior of the restaurant (the former home of Mabuhay Philippine) has received a fresh coat of paint and new dark brown flooring.  The restaurant was absolutely spotless, from floor to ceiling.  While there is no booth seating, there are plenty of tables, with built-in heating elements and matching red and black chairs.  While the restaurant offers free wi-fi, I couldn't figure out the password the owner shared with me.

My soft-spoken server appeared soon after I took my seat.  He diligently explained the different menu options, but there was a bit of a language barrier, so I didn't quite comprehend all of the information he was sharing.  I've been pigging out on pork lately, so I zeroed in on the prefabricated Spicy Pork Bowl ($7.95), ordered it spicy, and hoped for the best.

About five minutes later, my server dropped off my order and I immediately fell completely and hopelessly in love.  The aroma from the garlic and ginger in the potent broth immediately snapped my senses to attention.  To the delight of my taste buds, my hot pot was brimming with thick, chewy noodles, thinly sliced pork, plump dumplings and lightly cooked broccoli. I thoroughly enjoyed the all the variety the flavor-packed dish provided.  The restaurant offers three spice level (mild, spicy hot and super spicy) and the medium level provided appreciated heat without blowing out my palette.   While I normally loath Wisconsin winters, these hot pots are going to help my kick Old Man Winter's ass until spring returns to the Badger state.

Check your broth and protein choices on the plastic menu card with the provided markers. I can recommend the Szechuan broth if you like that tingly sensation. Then concoct a dipping sauce at the condiment bar using some of the many options.  

When your hotpot is bubbling you are ready to cook your chosen meat and other items as you see fit. The thin sliced beef and pork cooks completely in moments and is ready to dip and eat. The veggies take longer. The noodles from the bar are parcooked and ready to eat after warming up in the pot. 

Five stars for the nice service. They came around to top off the broth, and kept the water glasses full. The interior is spartan but clean. The prices on the menus are confusing.

The server was very fast giving us refills and the check when we were done. The aesthetics are pleasing also.

That brings me to the next point...
The menus were pretty dirty and sticky, and so were the glasses. No traditional music was playing and I just didn't feel like I was actually at a Chinese restraunt.

Besides some stuff being sticky, dirty, and no tradition music was playing everything else was great.

I will return Tuesday for the half off sushi, I can't wait to try it out!

One more edit: The atmosphere is cool, but there isn't many people here...I think the only reason for that is location.","2015-01-18 00:19:55"

The sushi didn't disappoint. I love Ikura fish eggs! The waitress recommended it as sashimi (no rice) instead of sushi (on rice), so I went with her suggestion. It came in a cute little cucumber cup!

The Thai dishes could definitely be spicier. I asked for very spicy Mussaman curry--a 7 out of 10, and requested extra spice on the side. She said it's incorporated in the dish, so there wasn't an option for the spice to be on the side. It came out as a huge portion with red pepper flakes, but there was absolutely no spice in this chicken curry ): 
It might have scored it a 2/10 on the spice scale. On the bright side, It had plenty of flavor from the curry sauce, the green beans, potatoes, onions, and pineapples.

Brown rice was an extra 50 cents, which is cheap compared to the +$2 markup at other restaurants. 

I was looking for dinner in the area, and I found Rice Inn through Yelp. It's a little out of the way for me, so I might not get a chance to come back-- but I'd recommend this place to others.","2016-06-15 16:55:29"

Usually though, we come here for what has become our favorite item at How Lee: the beef noodle soup. Straight up Sichuan style cooked in red hot chili soup, with tender beef and fresh leaves, these noodles cannot be beat, at least in the Squirrel Hill area. Sichuan Gourmet has several different beef noodle items as well, but they are somewhat inconsistent in their quality, and we have never found that to be a problem at How Lee.

The tone is set by the young hostess, who was dressed for the beach: a hooded sweatshirt, seersucker shorts, and flat canvas shoes.  If one is seeking ambiance, this is not the place, though it is reasonably attractive and comfortable, and the tables and booths allow plenty of space to relax.

Diners may bring their own alcohol and there appears to be no corkage fee for wine.  

The restaurant became extremely loud as the evening went on as some of the diners overindulged in wine.

The restaurant is in its first few weeks of operation, and it shows.

Our harried, but pleasant young female server forgot our request for water and hot tea.  After fifteen minutes, we received water after asking a second time. She was apologetic.  Later in the meal, a refill was provided without our having to ask.  We did not receive the tea.

My wife ordered a sushi platter with salad and miso soup with seaweed.  The good-sized salad with iceberg lettuce, carrots, and tasty ginger dressing arrived twenty minutes after the dinner order was placed, the soup a few minutes later. The sushi was brought to the table several minutes before my hot items. There were eighteen pieces in this large platter of sushi, which she enjoyed, a bargain for $10.95.

I ordered chicken egg roll ($1.95), chow fun noodles with pork (a flat, wide egg noodle) (yes, very unhealthful: a splurge), $9.00, and tofu (bean curd) with mixed vegetables: broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, snow peas ($8.95). The egg roll came within a few minutes of ordering, but  it was a vegetable roll, not the chicken variety I had ordered.  Instead of asking me whether I wanted the vegetable roll, the server instructed me to eat it and that she would order the chicken roll.  I did as she directed and consumed both.  Neither was particularly tasty and both were served lukewarm, at best.  Both of the entrees were a good portion, tasty, and served in delicious sauces: not too oily, but the tofu dish was drowning in the sauce, causing it to be soggy. Both dishes were the proper temperature: steaming hot.  Neither of the large platters was brought with any serving utensil.

Although the take-out menu shows an American Express icon in the section where accepted credit cards are listed, the server told me that the restaurant does not accept it.

I understand the husband and wife owners, Mr. and Mrs. Ho, are lovely people, but they were apparently not present on this evening.  No owner or manager was overseeing the dining room and no one other than the server checked on us.

In most respects, I compare Rice Inn unfavorably to my favorite Asian restaurant in the area, Red Tea House in the Virginia Manor Shops in Mount Lebanon.  Red Tea House is somewhat more expensive and the portions are somewhat smaller, but it consistently offers great service and artistically-presented cuisine, ambiance, and top-notch management, which oversees the dining room and makes every guest feel welcome. Water and tea are not ever forgotten at Red Tea House because these items are brought when the server first approaches the customer, along with delicious crisp noodles (alas, also unhealthful.)

For value, convenience, and reasonably good food, I am likely to return to Rice Inn on occasion, but it is not at the top of my list.

My whole table ordered noodles with soup. My soup came with pork and pickled vegetables. The taste of the broth was complex and I everything I tried. It's always really satisfying being able to find a soup that has a nice depth of flavor and a perfect amount of oil. The noodles were cooked really well and the pork was super tender. The beef noodle soup was pretty good as well. It's not as good as the homemade beef noodle soup my grandma makes and it's not as good as the beef noodle soups I get overseas but it passes the flavor test of a beef noodle soup in a restaurant in America. It was really filling but not too heavy. The noodles were also cooked well and the meat was tender with the perfect amount of salt.

The service here is a little bit subpar. It can get difficult to grab a table during lunch / dinner times because you have to seat yourself. A lot of single diners come here and sit at four person tables because of the lack of smaller tables or booths. Dirty plates are also not immediately taken away and so a lot of tables are empty but occupied by trays full of used bowls. We sat at a table with dirty plates and it took about 25min for the items to be removed. I think this problem can be attributed to understaffing. The whole time we were there, there was just one girl taking orders at the counter and clearing the plates.

After finding that the Korean and sushi place in Parma were closed on Sundays (why oh why???), we quickly looked on Yelp, looking for an Asian place to go. Having passed Wild Ginger by the entrance of the freeway before, I said, why not? And off we went.

It's a nice restaurant- not your typical authentic Chinese restaurant which is usually small and kind of dirty. Also, their food wasn't very authentic at all. Sigh. I don't even know why I had hopes it might be good.

First, my friend ordered all calamari. It was completely a deep fried ...... thing. None of us couldn't even find the calamari in these big pieces of deep friedness. Bleh bleh.

Next the entrees:

Singapore noodles: Usually I love singapore noodles. But man, here.... it wasn't flavorful and just kind of...blah. 

Sesame Prawns and Scallops: That actually was okay. Still..... not authentic, but that was alright.

Chow fun- um no. I'm Canto- and those were NOT Cantonese noodles. The noodles were these weird skinny consistency, and it seemed like they cooked with dow see. I mean, I love dow see, and I like it with the fish in the can it comes with, but...ummm....on chow fun? I think not.

The service was rather slow- and there was only one other party in the entire restaurant at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. And our water wasn't getting refilled. Boo.

Yeah, not a fan. Maybe if you like the non-traditional stuff, go ahead...but if you like authentic Chinese places, this is not the place to go. I should have known when she started recommending the General Tso's chicken (which is NOT a typical Canto dish, by the way....ugh).","2011-10-23 12:23:38"

As someone who is not amazing with spice (I can handle it but not to ridiculous levels), it was not bad at all. If you get lettuce/spinach as a side and let it soak in the broth, it is going to be pretty spicy - but for meat, mushrooms, etc. it is perfect!

It is pretty expensive, and I would NOT recommend getting the combo. I got that the first time I went and it was way too much food. They bring you the meat and a sample tray of veggies/meats/other foods and it was more than enough. It ended up coming to around $18 and I only finished just over a half of it.

The service here is incredibly friendly and accommodating, and they clearly are used to dealing with English speaking clientele.

Surprisingly, the servers were Cantonese. I liked this because I could speak with them without much trouble, but this is where I thought the food might have been a bit lacking. We got our usual, which is fish fillets in spicy broth and pea shoots. The pea shoots were a bit on the tough side (might just have been due to what was available) and we were able to get the fish fillets a bit more mild than usual. Maybe getting it mild was where we went wrong - Sad to say, but the fish fillets at China Star are significantly better. Allow me to explain just a bit - the fish fillet dish at How Lee's was a bit ... cantonesed (i.e., they had thickened up the soup base with corn starch, which is a pretty typical cantonese thing to do). Also, the fish fillets were a bit on the doughy side, which I think probably had everything to do with the fish they used. 

Anyway, this is not a crazy indictment - it was still really good Chinese food, especially by Pittsburgh standards. I especially liked it because I could actually speak with the servers.

My boyfriend loves authentic Asian cuisine so he always gets something from the authentic menu (e.g. the spicy prawns, chongqing chicken) while I get something far less adventurous (chow fun, hor fun, etc.) to give my poor tongue a break from the spice after I steal a few bites of his meals.  

Love this place for both eat-in and take-out and highly recommend this place as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh.","2012-09-04 12:02:49"

We took a visit down to Rice Inn and upon entering we were greeted by a friendly Asian waitress (no surprise there) and she sat us down and almost immediately asked what we wanted to drink. Now it seems they have a thing with tea seeings as how she brought a cast iron pot over and started by pouring us mugs of it (upon request of course as she asked if we would like tea) and I will say it was quite good. Our first thoughts were on the decor, it was quite dated but oddly nostalgic. The reason for this come to find was that the place was built inside of an old Pizza Hut that closed down about 5-6 years ago. As for our waitress she spoke English but her accent at times was a bit hard to grasp and did happen to cause a misunderstanding about our leftovers being boxed. But nonetheless she was very attentive and respondent. After placing our orders the food was shockingly on the table in under 3 minutes! Albeit the place was a ghost town as there were about 4-5 other customers in the entire building, but still fast nonetheless. My sushi was pretty good although I didn't fancy the chewy salmon in my salmon roll. The California roll was about as good as a California roll can be so that was nice. The fantastic roll was oddly warm on top but I found I kind of liked it as it added some depth to the mouthfeel. And the ginger salad on the side did not look very visually appealing but tasted decent, I would go for the wanton soup as a side if I ever went again though (I most likely will). And as for the person I was with they got the sesame chicken with white rice and wanton soup as a side. They said that the rice was perfect but the chicken had an odd texture and it was much too sweat. They gave the wanton soup rave reviews however. I also ordered a takeout of orange chicken with white rice for one of my family members and they even said it was getting hard to eat it near the end seeings as how sweet it was, they compared it to panda expresses orange chicken saying it's about 5x sweeter and not nearly as good. I would recommend sticking to Japanese food if you plan a visit. Overall my experience was a good one and I recommend it to any hardcore fish fans in the area. 3/5","2019-02-01 23:04:02"

"H0fHLcnv2HZduMJ0ztsahQ","231WruJwGq6km5I8qskGBQ","QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw",4,2,1,0,"Newbie to Hot Pot (so much that I had to look it up on youtube!), but saw the fun reviews from fellow yelpers and thought ""I need to try this!"" I admit I was scared about the ""cooking my own RAW chicken meat"" (from one plate, touching everything under it, to the reusable soup, one set of chopsticks that touch raw, soup, and cooked) without any friend there to ""hold my hand"" - I mean I was FREAKED. But everything went well and I had alot of fun.

So for those of you new like me and without a guide:
1) You sit down and pick soup base + meat choice. ASK to sample the broth before choosing.
2) Your soup base is just for cooking - you're NOT going to pour it back over noodles. 
3) As your base warms to boil, go to the condiment buffet and pick up stuff you would like. I had done some youtubing beforehand, so I used a couple of sauce recommendations from there, but really my favorite was the (only) one the restaurant provided (on the glass of the buffet server). Another one I liked is a ""traditional"" sauce from some province in China: 1 ladle sesame paste + 1 spoon chive paste.
4) While your base is still warming up, or if you took forever to get your ""extras"" like me, I added scallions, chili oil, cilantro, and garlic. I wanted to ""spruce up"" the mushroom base soup. It smelled fine, but I do like a ""little"" heat (like a level 1 on 5). The yelpers scared me on the heat levels from the ""Kimchi"" and ""Szechuan."" Someone mentioned asking for a level one, but this was not an option during my visit. My extras on the ""mushroom"" broth ended up perfect for me. In fact, as a salt loving American, once the broth condensed a little, it was a knock out!
5) Next, add hard veggies. Now there are NO signs to tell you how long to cook anything. I think I let the broccoli cook for 4-5 min - a tad too mushy. The corn was 20 min - ok. The fish and shrimp balls, fried tofu, soft tofu were 1-2 min - they were fine for me and surprisingly tasted better than the chicken. ""Fish ball"" sounds ""fishy"" to me, but they were flavorful and a nice chew (kinda like a softer matzo ball). I never used the soft veggies (leaves).
6) Then, the meat. The server mentioned 30 secs - 1 min for the raw chicken slice. It does change color enough to notice if it's still raw, but I made sure to kill it a little extra. Chopsticks: to kill the chicken bacteria, redip the chopsticks in the boiling soup. In fact, I LEFT them in the boiling soup for the 1 min that my chicken was cooking. The fake crab and some weird white shaved ""fish"" (?) slices took about 20 sec to cook. I was NOT coordinated enough to time all this perfectly the first time out, so I just cooked one or two things at once then ate as they were coming out (Redip those chopsticks FREQUENTLY).
7) Once I got all my goodies cooked and eaten. I went for the ramen noodles (2 min), adding fresh chili oil, scallions, garlic, and cilantro for the cooking and post-cooking. By this point the corn was ready, and I added it to the noodles. Great noodles! 4/5

Cons:
Contrary to other reviews, on my visit, there were no eggs and no fresh fruit.
I wish they had an extra list of how to make sauces - since we did go to cook our food, I like having recipes!
I would also like something to tell me how long to cook the items. Again the recipe thing.
Lunch price has increased (from yelp reviews) - $12/person + $1.50 for a can of coke.

Overall:
Fun and tasty. But it's only as good as YOUR cooking that day. 3.5/5

Inside what seems to be an old Pizza Hut, Rice Inn is nicely decorated and appears very clean as my first impression.

As for the food, my fiancee and I ordered the rainbow roll, the fantastic roll, and salmon and red snapper nigiri. The fish tasted quite fresh, and the rolls were neatly made. The service was very quick; we probably weren't waiting more than 10 minutes for our rolls, even though the restaurant was starting to get busy for dinner on a Friday night. I was expecting the fantastic roll, which was considered spicy, to only by seasoned with spicy mayo as many ""spicy"" rolls are, but the crunchy tuna was actually spiced inside the roll with a little more kick. It was *fantastic.* The rainbow roll was also delicious, with fish and avocado on the top of the roll, as opposed to all the fish inside the roll as some other restaurants make.

Overall, it was priced about the same as what you would expect from most sushi joints, ~$12 for a higher-end roll and ~$4 for nigiri. The waitress was friendly, and for the quick service and good sushi, I would wager we will be back soon!","2018-09-14 22:45:53"

Rice Inn's Thai options are fantastic, the pad thai is some of the best I've had in the 'Burgh.  The portions are enormous, a little larger than necessary (doggie bags are necessary here).  If you order dishes with beef or chicken, you receive large chunks of fresh meat, not the small cuttings found at some Chinese restaurants.

We initially wanted to sit next to our hotpot but he insisted we sit behind it. Surely as our table for four, but only with the two of us, began to fill up with bowls of sauces and things to cook, we saw the wisdom in this. We both chose the Schezuan broth, which was spicy enough to make me eat slowly but so good with the ala carte noodles, that I just had to keep on eating or feel the burn. The broth was too spicy for my husband, and the owner graciously took the broth back to tone it down. Every once in a while, our hot pots would be refilled with broth. The meat and fish we had was good and fresh. We also enjoyed all the extras, tofu, mushrooms, spinach, etc, that was included. 
Dinner took us about 1 1/2 hrs from start to finish. Plan accordingly. We went there at 5:30 on a weeknight and the restaurant was slowly filling up by the time we left. Leftovers can be taken home and make a great next lunch/dinner.

From the moment you walk in, it laid out like every Chinese restaurant. The one thing that sets it apart is the quality (and the taste) of the food. Looking at the few reviews this place has (most over 2 years ago), I think this place serves the best Americanized Chinese food in Cleveland. 

My go to is the chicken & beef with broccoli and it is the best I've tasted. Their general tso chicken is pretty good too. They have a lot of options and I've never been disappointed by their food. 

I've talked to some of their customers and they come from as far as Eastlake and Beachwood just to get carry out.

My test?  ""Kung Pao Chicken.""  It's always the first thing I try at a Chinese restaurant, because I have experienced Kung Pao Nirvana, and I have had way too many disappointments.  A disappointing Kung Pao experience usually leads to ""no second chance"" from me because there are choices one can make.

When I saw the ""grand opening"" signs for Rice Inn at the old Pizza Hut location next to Walmart in Bethel Park, I didn't want to get my hopes up.  I actually waited until I saw a couple of Yelp and Urbanspoon reviews before I decided to get my dining partner to join me for a meal there.  (you can't be too careful these days...)  My first impression was, ""HEY, they've actually dressed up this old Pizza Hut pretty well!""  They even managed to do something with those weird trapezoid Pizza Hut windows that we all know and love.  The place was simply decorated, and was very inviting to the first-time guest.  (maybe the odd familiarity added to that?)  Comfortable seating, low noise level, attentive hostess (who turned out to be the manager) and an eager young waiter all made us feel good about our choice to try Rice Inn from the very start.

The first thing we noticed on the menu were the letters ""BYOB.""  We immediately sent our young accomplice to the nearby Giant Eagle to procure some bottles for us.  I simply love the whole BYOB concept, especially when there is no ""corkage"" fee.  Upon opening the menu, I was impressed with the depth that it contained, and since I had read that this new restaurant had good sushi, I ordered the ""Baked Alaska Roll"" as an appetizer.  I am unable to resist any roll that has smoked salmon on it, and this one did not disappoint.  It was expertly prepared, very well presented, and the ingredients seemed fresh and tasted delicious.  The only bad part was that it was cut into 8 pieces and there were 3 of us, so I had to graciously (and reluctantly) deny myself a third piece!  This was an odd roll, because as the name implied, it was served warm.  But I really, really liked it, and so did my compatriots. (who got 3 pieces, unlike me...)

I was feeling great about this place almost immediately because we got to watch the sushi chef prepare our roll, and we got to drink exactly the beer that we wanted (Yakima Glory) instead of settling for the usual run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant offering.  We decided to try a nice cross-section from the menu to find out where the strengths and weakness might be.

We ordered a seafood soup for two, an order of Kung Pao chicken with fried rice (only 75 cents to upgrade from the steamed rice) and an order of Pad Thai, of which we are huge fans.

In a word, the Kung Pao chicken was ""perfect.""  This is the dish that always lights me up when it is done correctly, and the kitchen at RICE INN nailed this one.  Tender, perfectly cooked chicken, crispy texture in the vegetables and nuts, and a sauce that was exactly what I was hoping for.  A++ and the best I've had in the South Hills of Pittsburgh.  The seafood soup got a B minus.  Everything was in there as advertised, and nothing in the soup was overdone or tough.  Obviously the kitchen used fresh ingredients.  But personally, I thought that the soup itself was somewhat lacking in seasoning and overall seafood taste.  This may be a personal taste thing, but I wasn't that excited about the soup.  My friends, however, enjoyed it more than I.  As for the Pad Thai, it was not what I was expecting.  I have had a lot of GREAT Pad Thai lately because this is one of the major strengths of one of my favorite restaurants located a few miles up the road on 88.  This Pad Thai needed to go back to the drawing board, in my opinion.  The shrimp was tender enough, and the rice noodles were just about right, but the seasoning of this dish just didn't do justice to the Pad Thai tradition.  After offering some feedback to our young and enthusiastic waiter, ""Morgan,"" I wouldn't be surprised if the chef made some adjustments on this particular menu offering.  It's hard to do EVERYTHING well, and since this place has only been in business for a month, I'll expect some improvements on this one.

My overall impression could be summed up in these words:  ""Do you have any TO-GO menus?""  I will definitely be coming back to RICE INN to explore the menu further and find out what other offerings on the menu are ""in their wheelhouse.""  It will not surprise me to find out that they do a lot of things well, based on this first visit.

I'd also like to make mention of the fact that the hostess who turned out to be the manager listened to the feedback we gave our young waiter on the food we were served, and she unhesitatingly removed the cost of the Pad Thai from our bill without any suggestion from us.  I really respect this desire to please!","2013-04-19 04:09:53"

I recently tried their different style dish on the hotpot menu, where you can choose your base and add to it per item. It was perfectly hot, spicy, and tasty and all of the ingredients were delicious. I also have tried the noodle soup here, and would definitely go for the hotpot over this.

The main factor that would stop me from returning is the customer service.  They were busy but the waiters only seemed confused for our table in regards to our order.  We had 3 combo meals (fish, beef and lamb) with coconut, kimchi and mushroom broth.  When the meal came out, they never gave us our lamb. When we asked for it, the waiter returned with our receipt and asked us to point out what was missing. If they already had time to correctly print out our receipt, they should also take the time to correctly give us our order.  I also never got the soda I ordered. We had to ask them to take the order off when we paid. 

The entire time we were there, we were never served water. When we asked for water, they only brought out one glass of water (there were 4 of us).  We had to ask for water again. The waiter brought out the water along with two plates of vegetables. He set everything down at the table next to us and then took the plates of veggies to the table across the room. He then came back to help other tables near us which resulted in him walking past us 3 times.  5 minutes later, we were served the waters that were set on the table across from us. 

I understand it may be a small family business but if they were taking time to talk and give free drinks to the table next to us, they could have tried a little harder to make sure our order was correct and serves us water as well.  Our table was the only one with no water. 

Overall, the best dish we had was the kimchi broth one. Mushroom and coconut broth literally only had coconut and mushrooms, very plain and simple.

The owners are very friendly. The menu is lacking in English explanations, but they are more than happy to explain to you how the menu works. One side of the menu is lunch and one side of the menu is the regular hot pot menu. 

If you've never had hot pot, the idea is a pot of broth is placed on your individual hot plate. You put raw veggies, thinly sliced meat, tofus, and whatnot into the simmering pot of broth. Wait for it to cook, then fish it out with your chopsticks or spoon, dip in some sauce and enjoy. If you've ever had the entree fondue at Melting Pot, it's that idea, but hot pot came first. 

For the hot pot menu, you can either order a soup base (5-6 different flavors including a mushroom broth, a szechuan spicy broth, and a spicy thai broth), and then pick the ""side orders"" you'd like to have for your hot pot, like meats, vegetables, tofus, etc. The soup base is about $5, and most of the side orders are about $2. But the better deal is the combo. With the combo, you have your choice of soup base, along with a particular meat, and it comes with a combination veggie plate that includes a variety of items like spinach, napa cabbage, tofu, enoki mushrooms, lapchang, corn, fish balls, and more. The combo is only $15 at night, and I believe they have a lunch special version for $10. There's also an all vegetarian combo, which you can order with a mushroom broth.

The sauces are on the side, and they're plentiful: minced garlic, cilantro, green onions, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, peanut sauce, fermented tofu sauce, oyster sauce, etc. There are also eggs and noodles for the end of your hot pot, but I didn't get a chance to partake because I was so full. 

The broth was so flavorful and delicious. I ordered the Szechuan spicy broth and it was certainly spicy. If you're not a spice person or only like a little bit spice, I wouldn't go with this one. Both my dining partner and I really enjoyed this meal. The service was fast (they keep the broth ready, and you do much of the cooking yourself), and very well priced. They're a bit of a trek being on Park Street, but they are well worth it.","2016-03-30 02:11:18"

The location is in a strip mall on Park Street. Once inside, the restaurant is open, airy, and pretty plain. We were greeted immediately, welcomed, ushered to a table, and asked if we had had Hot Pot previously. Although my partner and I have, my sister and her husband had not. Our hostess explained how to order and said they would walk us through it when ready. We all ordered a combination platter and selected our protein and broth. There were I think around ten broths to choose from. Our hostess checked with each of us to see what spiciness level we wanted.

While our plates were being prepared, we checked out the sauce bar. It includes various prepared sauces as well as ingredients like garlic, cilantro, and chilis which you can add to each sauce. Valuable to us, it included a recipe for a dipping sauce which was fantastic! Coming up with my own sauce was daunting. Following the recipe to make this delicious sauce was awesome. There were also eggs, noodles, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and rice noodles which you could add to your hot-pot. Strainers were available which you could use to help lift your food out of your hot-pot.

Soon our hot-pots were delivered to our table. Each person has their own hot-pot and burner. Our host set our hot-pots to heat, explained what each ingredient in our combination plate was and offered tips on how long to cook each item.

The ingredients were all fresh and plentiful. The flavor in my szechwan broth was delicious and the perfect spice level. (I drank quite a bit of the broth when I was done w/my meal.) As I mentioned before the dipping sauce was outstanding.The noodles were hard to pull out of the broth and I didn't care for my partner's coconut broth which I found bland, but other than that is was a fun and delicious meal.

I've been to other hot-pot restaurants and the service and quality of this experience really set it apart.

I'd only ever experienced the Convoy St. shabu shabu in San Diego, CA and could not wait to see how this would compare. So...I made plans, met up with my foodie partner in crime and we had lunch there yesterday afternoon. The service was friendly and the food exceeded my expectations. 

We each ordered the $9 hot pot lunch special...which comes with a plate overflowing with a variety of vegetables and meats...topped with your primary choice of meat (chicken, beef, pork or lamb). We were also given the option to select our own individual choices of broth. Based on previous reviews, I was torn between the kimchi broth and the Szechwan broth. We each selected the Szechwan spicy broth and ordered a side of scallops and a side of beef balls. 

Our individual hot pots were quickly brought out and we were also educated on how to operate the table burners. While our broths heated up, we made our way to the sauce bar towards the back of the restaurant. There was a very nice variety of sauces, fresh herbs, noodles and spices. I grabbed a bowl and made a dipping sauce concoction...no...dipping sauce masterpiece, filled a plate with uncooked noodles and we happily returned to our now boiling broths.

Our meat and vegetables soon followed and we commenced to eating...well, more like commenced to placing our food into the very aromatic boiling broth and then eating. 

As it takes a few minutes for your meats and veggies to cook in the broth, there was time for laughing, talking and catching up between two old friends while we dined. The hot pot was wonderful, the service was very friendly, and the prices were very reasonable... I believe this may now be one of my favorite eating spots in Madison!!

Dining Tips: 
- Don't forget to look up while you are at the sauce bar. It is very easy to miss the additional sauce and seasoning options sitting just above your head while you're focusing on making your dipping sauce masterpiece.
- Make sure to grab an extra plate or bowl from the sauce bar to use as a ""cooling station"" for the items you've removed from your boiling hot pot. *Insert hot pot items directly from the hot pot straight into your mouth at your own risk...lol...very hot!*
- Unless you are specifically wanting items such as shrimp or scallops...when ordering the hot pot lunch special...there is really no need to order extra items such as beef balls or veggies...unless of course you just want more than what they are already providing you with.
- The Szechwan broth is in fact spicy (which for me...is a good thing) and gets spicier as it cooks...which may not be good for those who can't or don't tolerate spicy foods very well. If spicy hot appeals to you...then you're good to go...but if you're looking for a little less spicy than you may want to opt for one of the other broths instead. 

Last but not least....ENJOY!!! I know that I did *Big Smile*","2016-01-03 19:16:29"

It was ok at the beginning but ever since 2018sp when they started to advertise and business got better. I have had 3 very bad experiences there. 1¡¢I used to like their handmade dumplings. I ordered one dish but after 40 minutes waiting ( and during that period I asked if my dish was ready and they said they were making it already) then they realized oh they forgot. Fine. 2¡¢I ordered hot spicy noodle a week ago and I realized the materials inside the dish were only 2/3 of what I had last semester. 3¡¢today I ordered hot spicy noodle with beef. Well it served fast, I guess within 10 minutes. But what I had was an almost COLD and NO FLAVOR noodle and beef. When I complained to the sales guy he didn't care. I guess with all of the advertising( especially in wechat) their business got better and quality became the opposite.

I would say I would never go there again.

Also had the chongqing dry hot chicken. I asked them to make it a little less spicy, so I'm not sure how spicy it originally is.. It was nice and crispy, covered with red chilis and sesame seeds. Yum! You can also get the chengdu version, which is unbreaded, so I wanna try that next time.

Since the owner decided to renovate the restaurant and try to make it a ""classy"" Chinese dinner, not only the prices doubled but the quality of the dishes became worse. There is inconsistency (all the time) with: 1)  Portions;  2) Sauce (quantity and taste);  3) How well the meats are cooked (got my chicken raw on last visit). Most important is the attitude of the owner towards the customers and some of the girls that work there. 

In one occasion, I ordered ""chicken with mixed vegetables"" and the carrots were sour and saggy with bad smell (seemed to be left overs from previous day). When I explained this to the owner (on another visit, 3 weeks later) she insisted that there is nothing wrong with her dishes and became aggressive, then concluded that I must have been mistaken. On another occasion, I asked the girl on the front desk for some extra soy sauce (packed in small plastic packages) and she refused to give me saying that my meal (carry out) included one pack.

The place is very easy to miss since the sign is a super generic red and yellow Chinese restaurant sign in a small plaza next to Copps. Don't let this scare you off; it's a genuinely great place!

Before arriving, I read that they had free WiFi, so I brought my laptop to watch anime on assuming that I would take a long time to eat (since hot pot is a very relaxed, not rushed kind of meal). Instead of your typical rude Chinese restaurant staff, I was greeted by a friendly man and a friendly woman which instantly gave a ma and pa feel from the get go. They seated me right away.

I ordered a beef and vegetable combo with szechuan broth. The combo said that it would come with vegetables and your choice of meat, so I was expecting this to not be such a great deal for $14.95. I was so wrong!

They gave me a big plate of frozen beef slices that what stacked high enough to have trouble not causing a beef avalanche as I grabbed for some. The vegetable plate was actually kind of modest in terms of vegetable selection: corn on the cob, spinach, enyoki mushrooms, and nappa cabbage. However, the ""vegetables"" also included clams, imitation crab, thai fish cake, fish balls, beef balls, spam, sausage, rice cake, firm tofu, fried fish cake tofu, and probably some more stuff that I don't remember. As an added bonus, they had unlimited noodles (and three different kinds), unlimited raw eggs, and unlimited small oranges to eat after dinner. They also had 16 different sauces and toppings. I added minced garlic, cilantro, and green onion to my broth then used barbecue sauce, sesame sauce, and fermented tofu for dipping.

I took my sweet time; I slowly cooked my hot pot ingredients and watched three episodes of anime while I doing it. I think I just found my new favorite alone time activity!

I found the flavor of the broth to be a little too salty (nothing water can't fix) but also very savory. The szechuan peppercorns didn't leave a sour numb taste in my mouth, and I'm grateful for that because it usually bothers me.

In case you were wondering, they do not have an all you can eat deal. However, I found the beef combo to be plenty of food even for me, and I'm a 240 lb powerlifter with a big appetite who came here immediately after a lift.

Even though I'm giving Mini Hot Pot five stars, I did wish that there were some things different about the place. First of all, you can't order other foods during dinner time; all they serve is hot pot! Before I knew how huge my hot pot was going to be, I was hoping I could order some sort of appetizer like crab rangoon or dumplings. Secondly, I wish the combo included watercress and more mushrooms. Finally, I wish they had whole cilantro available. I like to add cilantro as a vegetable to my hot pot. If they have it chopped as a free topping, surely they can provide it without be chopped too.

However, all those pieces of criticism are minor. Mini Hot Pot has a really special experience to offer. I've had lots of hot pot and shabu shabu in Chicago and San Francisco, but I'd rather go to Mini Hot Pot over all of those places because I've never had a more customizable and inviting hot pot experience. With such a big focus on restaurants near the capitol or on Willy Street, it's easy to miss this gem.

The best I had ever had.  They give 2 wontons and the broth, mixed with cabbage.  I highly rated this a 10.  The egg roll was good.  Wasn't greasy.  The lunch dishes were served after we finished the soup and egg roll.  They waited for a while for us to eat it.  General Tso's was really saucy, the chicken was crisp and was on the sweet side.  I never had anything like this before.  It was different from other places, but it was good.  I rated that a 10 also.  However, I think they could give a little bit more rice with the meal.  It was 7.00 for Lunch and my partner paid 8.00.  The sweet n sour shrimp was good also as it was served with the sauce on the meat, with peppers, onions and pineapple.

Another thing that bothered me was that the waitresses idly stood by the counter and stared at my friends and I the whole time we were there. As my friends and I were deciding what we were getting, three different waitresses went to our table to ask if we were ready to order which didn't make sense since they were standing right in front of us. 

The menu itself is very well organized and offers authentic Chinese food. Since How Lee specializes Sichuan style food, they had a whole separate section for that. The nice thing about the Sichuan section is that you can tell them your preference for spiciness. Since I have no tolerance, I ordered the pork belly and leeks without any spice. The pork belly was cooked perfectly although I was disappointed that it wasn't actually slices of pork belly but pork with fat running through it. The portions are huge so you definitely get your money's worth. I ended dog bagging leftovers equivalent to another meal.

These two websites look identical and the phone numbers are the correct numbers for the actual restaurant, but are complete fraudulent sites. The orders get sent into who knows where and the food that comes is complete BS rip-off hands down THE worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. 
Okay the story goes...
I had pretty good experience going to double 10 so i decided to order delivery from their website. I checked to see if the address and phone number on the website was accurate so I submitted an order for 4 dishes with my friends. The food did come, except only 2 items out of the 4 showed up. The ""handmade dumplings"" were some sort of frozen dumplings that tasted like shit. ""beef rolll"" was just a scallion pancake, and my other traditional Chinese dishes did not come at all. I called the number on the website in which I ordered from to complain. The owner (of the real double 10) informed me that I did not submit an order with them. There were no deliveries out to my place at all. She asked if I wanted to place another order, but at that point I was so pissed that I wasted 40 bucks on like 5 frozen dumplings and scallion pancakes. The owner said double10delivery.com is not their website, so she doesn't know who provided me with my order. BUT HOW CAN YOU BE AWARE THAT A THING LIKE THIS EXISTS AND NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?????
I didn't even know if my food was edible because I have no idea where it came from. For all I know it could've came from the dumpster somewhere so I ended up throwing the whole thing away.

Double 10 is a long-awaited addition to the increasingly diverse Chinese food scene in Madison. Most ""authentic"" Chinese restaurant serve Szechuan/Sichuan food (spicy)--places like Fugu, Soga, and Ichiban; while some serves Cantonese/Guangdong cuisine--like Wahkee or Lee's Garden on the west side. These restaurant are all good, verified (by myself) as ""authentic"", but in a way, lack of menu diversity.

And then, Double 10 brings something entirely different to Madison--cuisine hauled from northeastern China. In two visits, we had ""slide pork"", ""pork with sour napa"", ""pork with dry bean curd"" etc. They were items not found in any other Chinese restaurant in Madison, and of course, all very delicious.  

When we visited, almost every table ordered ""North East Flavour Pork Bone"" and that is something we aim for in our next visit. 

The staff was friendly. The dining area is a bit small, but good enough for small group gathering. The price is very reasonable, too. I hope they stay in business for long.","2014-02-09 19:12:25"

In addition to their normal menu, they offer a very extensive list of authentic Chinese dishes, which are both delicious and high quality.  I think their chef is doing a great job, and I hope that they continue with their level of service and quality into the future.

If you have never tried more authentic Chinese cooking, do yourself a favor and reach out of your comfort zone a bit!  You will not be disappointed.  Many of the traditional dishes are spicier than some of my friends can handle, so if you're like them, don't be afraid to order the dish and ask them to tone down the heat a little.

Here's my history:

I tried the spicy eggplant, which was extremely fragrant and tasty, not to mention, beautiful.  The plate literally glowed purple, that's how fresh the eggplant was.  My friend ordered the Cumin Beef, which was also amazing.  

11-8-13:  Ate there today and tried the black pepper chicken and the pork dumplings (both from the Chinese version menu), and both were amazing!  The pepper chicken reminded me of deep fried chicken with dry chili pepper that you'll find at some of the other more authentic Chinese restaurants in town.  And the dumplings were hand made!!

12-18-13: Ate there again today with others and we tried the cumin chicken.  AMAZING.  We also had the pork dumplings, which are just as good as the first time I had them.  They are a bit smaller now, but there are more of them, which I actually prefer.  At $6.00 for a plate full, it's a complete steal.  We also tried traditional (Chinese style) sweet/sour pork.  It was pretty good, but maybe a bit sweet for our tastes. 

12-20-13: The black pepper chicken changed, it was mostly fried bread this time, a bit disappointing.  Hopefully it was just a bad batch this time.  But their spicy green beans delivered.  AMAZING, they do it better than anyone else in town, IMO.  Definitely one of my favorite dishes there.

I'm really loving the traditional Chinese menu here, and it keeps growing!

It is right opposite whole foods, nice place for a quick stopover before/after grocery shopping. Or just whenever I feel like having some authentic northeastern chinese cuisine. From the outside, however, it looked small (well, it is small), so I almost didn't want to give it a try, thinking that it is just another american-chinese fast food place. But was I wrong! 

My first visit was on a rainy day, when we didn't feel like traveling far, and hence stopped in Double 10. My review is based on their local chinese menu/specials, b/c I haven't tried any of the american-chinese type food. I tried their kung pau chicken, shredded potatoes, fried noodles and rice, fish sauce egg plant, moo shu pork and the four season green beans. The dishes are very authentic. My boyfriend, who grew up in northeastern china, endorses their food too. 

As this is a largely family-run restaurant, and because the dishes are made to order, they are very good at customizing your dishes the way you want it. You can customize the level of spiciness, saltines, substitute rice for noodles etc. This is also the time to be creative. If there is a dish you want that is not on the menu, feel free to tell them about it, and they will make it for you. 

The bonus is that they carry fresh home made chinese dumplings with a variety of fillings, including a vegetarian option. Those dumplings are kind of pricey compared to the other items on the menu, but they are home made, so I would say that is a great trade off. But it depends on how much you are willing to fork out for your meal. 

This is a great place and a great addition to Madison, where traditional northeastern chinese food does not easily come by. For the adventurous people out there who are curious about northeastern chinese food, there is no better place to start than double 10, who are great at listening to what you want and then making it for you. One small note, seating is very limited, only about 5 tables, so ordering ahead and getting it to go is the safest bet, or you can get them to deliver straight to your door.","2014-04-29 02:46:08"

Layout / Interior:

I went around 11:30am hoping to beat the lunch rush but it was already busy.  There was only about 7 booths and they were all full. There were some chairs around the server window area but it's pretty close to the cash register so it wasn't comfortable having people coming in and practically standing over you while they ordered and paid for their food.  This place seems to be popular, too bad they don't have a bigger space to accommodate the crowd that wish to sit down and eat.

Customer Service:

When I arrived I was immediately asked for my order by the cashier.  Honestly, it annoys me that I can't have a moment to look at the menu options and decide on a meal.  I wasn't asked if I wanted take out or to dine in.  I really wanted to dine in, but there were no available booths and the cashier assumed I wanted a take out order.

Once while I was waiting for my food by the cash register, an older lady walked in and the brunette cashier/server asked if she wanted to dine in or take out.  The older lady didn't not answer her immediately so the cashier/server said, ""Like what, am I invisible?!""  I was shocked she would make that statement with me sitting right there within earshot.  The lady was older perhaps she simply didn't hear the server.  To the server, if you don't like working with the clientele - get another job or perhaps get from behind the cash register and actually walk up to greet the customers instead of shouting over people.

The food took about 15-20 minutes.  I ordered the General Tso. I get an hour lunch break, but for those who only have 30 minutes for lunch this probably isn't the place for you.  When I got the food, I opened the bag to ensure everything I ordered was in there.  The chef (and/or owner) practically stared me down while I was doing this.  I guess he was surprised that I took the time to make sure my order was right.  Either way, I didn't appreciate being stared down like that.

The Food:

Again, I ordered General Tso chicken with soup and egg rolls.  The egg roll was ok.  I didn't touch the soup.  As for the General Tso it was just ok as well.  Typical Chinese food fare, nothing special. I did notice with the last few pieces I ate that I had a difficult time chewing through the chicken.  I ultimately had to spit it out.  I'm not sure if the chicken was stale, but it shouldn't have been that tough. I was finished with the meal by then (about half way through my portion).  About an hour and a half later, let's just said I experienced some ""very uncomfortable stomach problems"".  Needless to say, I threw the rest of my order out.  

Pricing:
Reasonable.

Verdict:
I won't go back.","2018-03-22 14:51:55"

I always order an orange dragon roll which i believe is off the menu, they still honor my request however which is so sweet!

Their sashimi lunch special was up to my standard except for the salmon but maybe cuz I left it out for a few hours, everything else was exactly what I wanted. It came with the classic miso soup (so good) and salad (plain lettuce but what do you expect). Also had one of their special rolls and was up to par when compared a decent to good sushi restaurant.

The online ordering system is easy, but I find that calling is the easiest way to place an order.

On the positive side, Double 10 serves really good dumplings (and dumpling sauce), has fair prices, and is convenient for pickup purposes (right along University between downtown and Middleton).

On the neutral plane, Double 10's food is A-OK. Like previously mentioned, the dumplings are very good, but everything else has been just OK. The notable exception has been the egg drop soup, which is very bland and much more watery than we've had elsewhere.

On the negative side, Double 10 is somewhat disorganized and has been overwhelmed every time I've gone in to pick up food. There seems to be only one guy working the counter, taking phone and online orders, and helping people get their pick-ups when they come into the store.

I placed a take out order on-line and then went into the shop to pick it up. Everything was bagged up and ready to go on time when I arrived and all in all the transaction was very easy. The restaurant itself is on the small side and i imagine most of their business is take out or delivery. That being said, by the time we sat down to eat our delicious Chinese food was a bit cold and it probably would have tasted even better had it been hot and fresh. Here's what we enjoyed:

Hot and Sour Soup - Really tasty! Rich, flavorful soup with crunchy veggies and nice meat and tofu. Silky sort of mouth feel and overall VERY good. Nice to have the crunch of fried wontons to put on top, but they weren't really needed. 

General Tso Chicken - This was actually included for free since we had a big order. Large crunchy pieces of chicken with a sweet and slightly spicy sauce. Probably not the best General chicken ever, but very enjoyable. 

Mongolian Beef - Very good texture to the beef and tons of delicious onions. The sauce was really tasty as well, and again this would have been EVEN BETTER if it was nice and hot. Will definitely be ordering this again, it's a favorite recipe executed very nicely. 

Shrimp Lo Mein - Good, but not my favorite. Nice texture to the noodles for sure, which is really important. The shrimp were a little small and could have been a bit more flavorful, but they were cooked nicely. 

Hot Black Pepper Chicken - This was the winner of the night! Hugely flavorful with great crunchy texture and an amazing aroma. As good as the chicken itself was the mushrooms that soak up all the flavorful sauce were far and away the very best thing we had. If anything was going to be fought over it was this dish (and the gorgeous mushrooms in particular). 

Broccoli w. Garlic Sauce - Garlic sauce is really good, and while this was really purchased for a vegetarian guest I could see getting it again. If you are vegetarian I'd say this is highly recommended.

Sauteed Braided String Beans - This was also ordered for our vegetarian guest, but IT IS NOT A VEGETARIAN DISH! That being said, it was DELICIOUS! Loved this and will certainly be ordering it again in the future. Fresh, crisp green beans with a nice garlic and pork sauce; an absolute winner! 

Double 10 will likely become our new take out top choice for Chinese food. I'm very tempted to go try it as a sit down, but I'm worried finding seating could be a gamble. We're just a bit outside their deliver area, which is a bummer, but it's not really a terrible drive to get there and back. Highly worth a shot, especially if you're close and can enjoy the food as its served rather than as it comes out of a take out container...","2015-11-01 18:45:28"

With that said, the folks here do an excellent job and are nice people. 

My favorite is the dragon and phoenix (a mix of garlic shrimp and general tao's chicken with various vegetables) and I normally order wonton soup (the broth has turned out very watery sometimes but that hasn't been typical) and my wife goes for the sesame chicken and singapore noodle dish (I think that is the name but it doesn't appear on the online menu.

I ordered an assortment off the traditional Chinese menu for the three people in my family.  I ordered the chicken mushroom dumplings ($5.99), the pork with dry bean curd ($8.95), the sesame chicken combo meal ($7.29), and the North East Flavor Pork Bone ($10.95).  The cashier said it would take 15 minutes and I was happy she was correct with the time since we were hungry! 

The sesame chicken and chicken dumplings were standard, just average but tasty.  What we really liked was the pork with dry bean curd.  The vegetables, onions and green peppers, were julienne cut.  There was plenty of bean curd but not much pork.  The spicy sauce was wonderful and we all loved it. It went well with the white rice. 

The big disappointment was the most expensive entr¨¦e, the pork bone.  It consisted of soup bones with very little pork.  There were no vegetables and we ended up paying quite a bit for something that was 90% bone.  There were very few seasonings so the meat was very plain.

The negative aspects of the dining experience have little to do with the quality of the food (a note on this later). The purpose of this review is not to warn people about this place because, like I said, the food is really tasty. It's to offer constructive criticism to management from former restaurant workers to make dining in a lot more pleasant.

---

I don't know the name of the person who first waited on us. This isn't because I didn't remember--it's because she never introduced herself. The first thing she said after the host gave us our menus was ""do you know what you want to drink?"" followed a minute later by ""do you know what you want to eat?"" She, along with the other people who checked in on us throughout dinner, was pleasant, but obviously clueless about the steps of service.

Speaking of being checked on, we were one of three tables in the restaurant, yet somehow had three different people waiting on us. There is clearly not a section system in place, with all the servers sharing responsibility for all the tables. In theory, this is a helpful thing for when a server is in the weeds and can't even spare a minute to greet a table or refill a drink, but not when the restaurant has fewer than a dozen tables in the entire dining area. The amount of hovering and frequency of check-ins made it impossible for us to maintain a conversation for more than five minutes at a time before being interrupted.

By the time we were about 3/4 of the way through our sushi plate, one of the servers asked if we were going to need a box. Totally reasonable, and an appropriate time in the meal to ask that question. But after I told her ""no thanks, we're still working on it,"" she kept walking from the register to the kitchen, eyeing the plate for the first opportunity she could get to clear the table. When there was one piece of sushi left, she grabbed the plate while asking ""can I get this out of your way?"" When we responded with ""not yet, thank you"" she pulled her hand back and just stood there, waiting awkwardly for one of us to eat the last piece. Not exactly a great way to end a meal.

A note about the food:
My wife and I always get the two-person sushi combination plate. The miso soup is kind of bland, but it's free with the meal so who cares? The sushi (the important part) always tastes good, but it always comes out on a hot plate. I know for a fact that the fish is fresh and stored at a proper temperature in the sushi bar area, but it's kind of distressing to put warm raw meat in your mouth.

If management sees this review, please pass it along to your staff that customers know when you're trying to rush them through their meals. Honestly, I would understand that treatment if we were the only two people in the restaurant 20 minutes before close. But we weren't. It was 7:30 on a slow Wednesday. And for the love of god, please keep some chilled plates on-hand for the half of your menu that's served raw.

And to the people who are thinking of eating here: do it! The food is good! Just make sure you order it for carryout.","2014-11-11 02:37:16"

The seating is very limited and they turn tables over fast.   Service is excellent and everyone was sweet and kind.  The menu is extensive and includes Chinese and Japanese cuisine.

I started out with the wonton soup which was tasty, but served too hot.   I had to set it aside to cool down and before I got a chance to eat it, they brought our entrees.   I find that super annoying as I want to enjoy my soup and then move onto my entree.   We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Cashew Chicken and Chicken Lo Mein.   The Lo Mein was fantastic!   All the food came out hot and steamy.   The lo mein was full of flavor and a super choice.   The Kung Pao was just ok, as it wasn't spicy enough and therefore not flavorful.  The cashew chicken was very bland and not a good choice for  us.

What I didn't like, and it's because the place is so small, is that when people are waiting for take out orders they just stand in front of your table.   Awkward to have a conversation with people standing right next to you.","2016-09-04 00:48:51"

Ambiance: Typical small sushi shop with a small sushi bar that seats maybe 6 people and multiple tables and benches along the wall. The place was very clean and service was pretty friendly.

Food: The hibachi itself was excellent with perfectly seared beef which were moist and tender to the bite. The vegetables were cooked but still had a firm texture to them. All of this was tossed in a soy-based sauce and served with a side of your choice of rice vs fried rice. My only nitpick was the miso soup which I can't quite pin down but I think the brighter broth and green onions give it a distinctly chinese flavor. The edamame were also unsalted which is simply a matter of preference for most people.

We were pleased (though perhaps a little daunted) by the scale of the menu and wide variety of choices available. Ultimately we went with curry chicken and onion and chicken lo mein as well as a couple of pork egg rolls.

The egg rolls were crispy without being overly greasy, the balance between the meat and vegetables were good and on the whole they were one of the better egg rolls I've had.

The chicken lo mein was simply seasoned but delicious. The noodles were tender, no singed / burnt / hard noodles like you might encounter at other restaurants, and the flavor was savory but not overpowering. 

Much to my wife's dismay the curry chicken was spicy for her. I'd call it on the high end of mild / low end of medium but she's what you might call a ""spice wimp"" -- so other spice wimps be warned! You may wish to call your order in and ask to make sure your dish won't be too hot for you. It worked out well enough for me as the lo mein order was ample enough for two people to eat their fill and I wound up with lunch for a couple of days from the curried chicken.

There was a good blend of vegetables and chicken in the curry, the spice was pleasantly warm without being overwhelming (to me), but the curry flavor was more muted than I prefer. That's the only negative I can find with it.

I look forward to trying additional dishes from these guys! Perhaps I'll even really get adventurous and use the traditional Chinese menu next time.","2015-10-01 19:46:42"

The crab rangoons were wrapped differently in thinner won ton wrappers and tasted delicious! And all the food was perfectly prepared.

Then we ordered again last night and it was horrible! Probably the worst Chinese food ever. The mongolian beef was chewy and resembled fat. The boneless spare ribs were lined in actual fat. And the chicken fried rice was tasteless. The chicken with broccoli was good but probably because it was mostly vegetables and no chicken. The crab rangoons were back to normal and tasted fine but not as good as the first time when we tried Double 10.

Both takeouts have been hot and ready by pick-up time. The most recent order was from the lunch special menu.

There are 3 of us that ordered. Food was average. Delivery time was within an hour. Delivery person was extremely unprofessional and messed with our property and then laughed about it when we called him out on it. 

After talking about how cool our giant icicle was with my roommate for a few minutes at our door -- and after my roommate stated that we really liked the icicle this year because it's the first time in over 5 years that it extended from the roof all the way down to the ground -- my roommate gave the delivery guy a $5 tip.  As the driver started to walk to his car and my roommate was shutting the door, we suddenly saw the reflection of something bright and shiny flying through the air, followed by a maniacal laugh and crunching, thud noises. 

The driver had jumped over our porchside frozen tundra snow hill and punched (or kicked?) the 6'+ tall icicle free, sending it flying into pieces through the air. We were stunned, speechless (at first) and just like that, our whole meal was ruined before we even started eating. 

I feel it was extremely unprofessional, especially when we opened the door back up to shout at the delivery guy about how uncool his little stunt was, and he started laughing at us again.  I don't appreciate anyone messing with people's property like that, especially when they're on the job! We're never ordering from there again...

The restaurant in itself is a small low maintenance joint that serves primarily Cantonese food as well as baked goods. Unlike the Asian restaurants on state street, Asian Sweet Bakery has a low key, authentic charm with very good pricing (large quantity noodle soups for $6ish and breads for $2). 

To note, Cantonese food is unlike the Americanized Chinese + Szechuanese food you will find on state street. Asian sweet bakery does not serve stir fry; they have noodle soups, ""crepes"" (aka chow fun nothing like French sweet crepes), fried rice, and baked goods 

The soup broths have a bitter savory flavor accompanied with whatever assortment you choose. The baked goods vary from savory to sweet and are often much lighter in density compared to American baked goods, meaning they feel like clouds in your mouth and do not sit like rocks in your tummy.

I ordered the BBQ chow fun and the beef shank wonton noodle soup and then got a coconut bun and ""Chinese tamale"";) to go. 

Both dishes really hit the spot because it was such a cold winter day. The noodle soup broth was hot + filling and came with lots of noodle, vegetable, and beef as well. In terms of the BBQ chow fun, the taste is wonderful. I only wish they would add just a little more BBQ pork.

We came here for lunch on a weekend. It is a small, unassuming place, but they definitely sell more than just bakery items. Everything is very reasonably priced ($1-2), but we ended up not getting anything from the bakery section.

The prices here are extremely reasonable, I want to start off with (nothing over $7-8) and everything is very simple and authentic. The milk tea was honestly a bit disappointing, so I would stick to the delicious bottled drinks (it is what it sounds like, I think some tea boiled in milk). You can add in sugar to it to make it more like the type you would expect at a tea shop. The beef noodle soup was definitely not what I was expecting but light and tasty. We ordered it with homemade noodles which ended up being like thin egg noodles. There was napa and delicious thin beef strips, but the broth was light in color and thinner, lighter flavor (I just expected a dark beef noodle soup). The thousand year egg congee was delicious, though. I would definitely have that again; simple and sometimes what you need. The rice crepes that came out were huge (think of the dim sum ones but larger if you've never had them). They're homemade so that's nice and the sauce soaked right in.

The interior is just the simple fluorescent light, clean, plain decor that you would expect from a low cost bakery and lunch spot.  There are three tables and some chairs at a lunch counter. 

By authentic, I mean that the typical baked good has glittery shredded pork on top or red bean paste.  The meals, all five or six dollars, include beef with bitter melon and Fish fillet with black (fermented) beans and pork intestine.   

I predict this place will meet great success and so I look forward to an expanded menu.  Drinks like Pearl Milk Tea and Frozen Green Bean Paste Ice would really make this a snack place to be cherished!

The lady at cashier was very friendly and took orders carefully.  We ordered a bit of everything and I especially love their congee.  No tip either.

Price was pleasant for me--a bowl of congee for 1 person is 5, pretty cheap in the US.  We lived in HK before and I especially miss congee, especially when I am slightly under the weather, or not liking American food that much.  The congee here was good enough, and even my husband said it reminded him of HK again.

I like the fact everything is not overly seasoned. Congee not too salty, sweet bun not too sweet and seem freshly made, chang fen (rice noodle roll) lightly seasoned.  I finally don't need to tell them, less oil please, or if possible.

It is pretty carb oriented, but doesn't bother me at all (I love carb!). If you want you have other protein choices as well, even though I didn't really like the fish dish--small broken pieces of frozen fish saut¨¦ed with pickles, with rice, 6 USD.

I wasn't super impressed with the baked goods; the bakeries in Houston are better. But it's Madison, I guess they're ok by Midwestern standards. Congee was ok; mostly rice porridge; very light on the toppings. There is a distinct lack of seating, so you may end up getting things to go. If they could streamline the ordering process better, that would take them up a notch. So would putting in a larger seating area, and maybe printing up more menus. There were only two sets of menus.

When I first came to Madison, one of my friends took me here and to be frank, it was mix of disappointment and excitement. On one side this was one of or if not the only Asian bakery in town, on the other, there was a lot of the comfort food I was craving right in one place. 

Almost every time that I've came, I've gotten the B1 combination of congee with either egg or fish and no green onions with milk tea and a fried donut. The very first time, the milk tea was absolutely amazing. Ever since, I believe it's now a red tea with milk, giving it a pinkish color as opposed to a black tea with milk. The fried donut can be a hit or miss, depending on how fresh and crunchy or chewy it is. 

My recommendation though is to try the eel lunch box at its affordable price, you get quality eel (do watch out for fish bones) with rice and cabbage. It's just so savory and delicious; since we've discovered it, we've gone back for it multiple times! 

It's may be easy to miss, driving down Park St, but next time you're in area, do check out Asian Sweet Bakery. There's usually a spot or two for parking right outside the bakery but it's usually taken. Definitely try to find parking down on the Lakeside Street instead.","2017-08-20 13:08:25"

I remember all my favorite breakfast and lunch specials back home in Shanghai, and their baked goods selection covers most everything I expect. If there's anyone who wants to know what Chinese people eat, this is the place to be. Also it's quite affordable.

Having said that, the actual taste of the food was so disappointing. I got their fish congee (it taste better than it sounds), a pastry with red bean filling, and a hot milk tea. Usually these types of porridge are very savory, because they're stewed with preserved eggs and ham, and cooked using a meat broth, but what I got here was bland and boring. Maybe they skimped on the preserved eggs, because those things are umami bombs. The bun was mediocre as well - decent filling but kind of small, and the breading of the pastry was a bit dry. I say disappointing not in the sense that it didn't compare to the best I've ever had. It's disappointing because it didn't quite reach a good enough level where I feel satisfied, and I could see that it's almost there...but not quite.

I thought long and hard about whether to cave and bump up my rating for this place in the name of supporting ethnic food, but I couldn't convince myself that the meal I got was worth anything more than an ""A-OK"". No matter what the circumstances, the food must stand for and by itself, and as of right now it's not quite there.","2016-02-26 20:09:47"

I was a fan of the meal, and they had a solid amount of choices to explore.

The only downside is that the inside is relatively bare and there isn't a lot of seating, but it's worth your time to come in, if not for lunch, then for some of their delicious pastries to go.

I've tried quite a few items on the menu, and my favorites are the pork buns and the crepe dumplings. The ""Chinese tamale"", or glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leaf, was probably my least favorite item that I tried.

The sesame balls are pretty good, and the chive dumplings are a bit dry, more like potstickers than dumplings.

Everything in their glass showcase seems to be housemade and tastes exactly like the type of buns you would get in Asia or in any major China-town area in any big city like NYC.  They're big, fluffy, subtle (but delicious) in flavor, and incredibly inexpensive.  The couple who runs the Bakery is also very sweet so it only adds to the positivity of their already awesome goods.

For actual real savory food when you don't have a sweet tooth - their broths are fantastic.  I would definitely suggest grabbing one of the noodle bowls if you head by this way!  The one time I went, my friend and I ordered the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp and man oh man, I could've drank all of the soup in one gulp.  The individual components were fine on their own, but the broth brought them to a whole new level.  It was beefy and seasoned, and just tasted of what real Chinese food should be.

The Salt and Pepper Shrimp on the other hand was unfortunately not as OK.  I was so thrilled to see they kept the prawns with their heads on, but unfortunately they tasted old, as if they had been cooked earlier or on another day, and then reheated up in a microwave for the meal.  As a result, the flesh was very tough, and not pleasant to eat at all.  This is also one dish where the salt content was just a few levels too high.  I could feel my blood pressure climbing even just from one bite.

That said, you can't go wrong with their baked goods or soups, so dig into those!","2014-12-07 21:15:56"

There is one caveat to this five-star review: if you have had awesome Chinese food in China, or Chinatown in various large cities, you might not agree with me in giving this place five-stars. I think this place is great for Madison. 

I ordered the beef noodle soup with thick rice noodles. You can choose among thin rice noodles, thick rice noodles, and udon noodles. The soup base was bland like it's supposed to be, though it was a little too greasy for my liking. It had beef slices in it and Napa cabbage - definitely a feel good meal. My boyfriend got the Hong Kong style shrimp soup, where the shrimp is wrapped in wonton skin.

We got a few egg custards to go - they tasted like how they should. I didn't think they were too sweet and it still had about eggy taste. 

I had the rice dumpling for lunch today (sticky rice with meat wrapped in bamboo leaves). It was a little bland but satisfied my craving for it. 

I'm not sure if they make all their baked goods in store. I can't imagine that they would, since their kitchen is kind of small. Also, there's an Asian grocery store nearby, so maybe they get it from there?

  Anywhere from 2 to some times 3 nights a week I get dinner here, while I'm working.  Lately I have grown fond of the combination lo mien, and crispy crab rangoons. The servings here are  very  generous, I only regret that that the brown sauce doesn't adhere to the lo mien noodles that well. In some dishes I have had in the past the veggies were limp and tasted as if they had been made hours before.  

Because of having items like beer and broccoli that was less than stellar I haven't been to adventurous with trying other menu options.  The shrimp fried rice also leaves a lot to be desired.

I basically ordered everything I wanted to try during my first trip here, things I've been missing and craving, like steamed rice crepe with shrimp, rice porridge with fish and preserved egg. The beef and vermicelli noodle soup was good too, just a tad too much gristle. My hope is that they will expand or refresh the menu as business booms.

My $.99 investment proved to be even more of an adventure when I realized that selected bites of this bread/bun/danish also hid pockets of sweet custard.  Perhaps if it had been slightly warmed instead of refrigerated, the end result may have been ideal, instead of like a dystopian visit to a Shell station somewhere in the Pacific Rim.

I've been to Asian Sweet twice before, but I waited until my third time to pen this review because the first 2 times I went in the afternoon, and only for the bakery items, which by that time they were mostly sold out, so I only got to try very selected stuff. But today we made it right as they open after consulting friends who have pro tips (go early!). 

Their food items are a real deal, you can easily get a full breakfast complete with coffee/tea or a mix of coffee and tea (yuan yang) for less than $10. They offer all day breakfast and lunch items starting at 11 am. I will be going back to try their lunch items some time soon. The tofu and fish over rice looks amazing! We had the shrimp crepe, wonton noodles, chive dumplings and pork congee set today. The crepe, dumplings and congee were all nicely done. I found the wonton noodles a little on the plain side, probably cause we had that right after the crepe, which came with soy sauce. But that aside, the wonton doesn't have pork in them, only shrimps, not quite the best you can get in town, but not too bad. 

As I mentioned right at the start their freshly baked goods really stand out. Finally I got  the long awaited egg custard and char siew buns yay!! And they are really good. The red bean buns are another popular item on the menu too. These sell out fast. While I was in line I see different groups of people come in and grab more than ten bakery items at one go. Amazing!

There's a large display case by the cash register that's full of baked goods I recognize from childhood and jaunts to Santa Ana, and the menu sports a number of things I'm not sure I'd be able to find elsewhere in Madison (without inviting my mother over for a stay). 

However, I can't say the warm fuzzies extend to the food itself. The best thing there were the BBQ Pork Buns, which taste like Hawaiian bread filled with small diced pork pieces marinated in the pink stuff us Asians call ""BBQ"". They weren't the steamed buns (i.e. baozi, or b¨¢nh bao) I expected, but they were pretty good nonetheless. 

The BBQ Pork Fried Rice we got was pretty tasteless, mostly off-white rice, and needed a dousing of soy sauce before either I or my bf would eat it. (Likely the worse fried rice I've had in Madison yet, compared to places like Chang Jiang, Happy Wok, and HyVee.) 

We also got BBQ Pork Crepes and the shrimp crepes, which I wanted to like because I loved these back home. But.... Either the filling was scarce or the rice crepe was too thick, or both, but I couldn't really taste anything other than the crepe (which, by the way, isn't the dish's main attraction). They also came with plain old soy sauce instead of the usual fish sauce.... (Luckily, I had fish sauce at home and we had ordered to go. ) Guess I'll have to stick to Saigon Noodles on the weekends for my rice crepe fix.

I'm not sure what my fob parents will think when I take them here next time they're in town--if I take them here. They'll probably be delighted at the variety of things that look like what they're used to, but I'm afraid the taste will be foreign to them.","2015-02-22 19:40:26"

I headed here with a few of my friends, and ate on the first floor because the buffet was closed. I ordered the curry squid rice, and our food arrived relatively quickly.

The squid rice was dull, kind of undercooked, and tasteless. The squid was definitely just chewy curled in sliced fish, and was identified as tilapia by my culinary major friend. The curry was in big yellow clumps tucked into the rice. 

My friends got chewy general tsos and teriyaki vegetable beef, where the sauce looked better than the actual food.

Relative small buffet with the usual favorites. Soups: chicken wonton, veg hot & sour, egg drop. Lots of starch: white rice, plain fried rice, rice noodles, veggie noodles. Chicken included General Tso's (kind of gooey), kung pao chicken (greasy), chicken & broccoli, ""special chicken in spicy sauce"", sweet & sour chicken (i.e., breaded chicken fingers, sauce on the side). Also sweet & sour mushrooms (see chicken), Mongolian beef (or something close), veggie egg rolls, Szechuan pork, string beans, mixed vegetables, ""doughnuts,"" cut up melon, maybe one or two more items I forgot. Drinks included.

Food is good by cheap Chinese buffet standards. The sauces are a bit heavy (especially General Tso's), but have some flavor. Despite the labels, nothing is really spicy (including the hot sauce -- I've eaten here several times before, and they used to put out a very nice chili sauce. I don't know if the change is permanent or something happened today.). The fried stuff is not over greasy.

Everything well marked, quickly replenished (always crowded at lunch, which I guess is a good sign, with a steady stream of take-out as well) and so relatively fresh. You will probably have to wait a bit at lunch for a table. $7 plus tax.","2011-02-02 19:03:08"

My partner remarked how it was plain,  and in a good way. 

The pot stickers are where it's at!  They are pan fried,  golden pockets of perfection.  You can tell they were not dumped in the fryer from a frozen state,  rather formed by detailed and skilled hands and fresh ingredients were used in these little edible purses.

Long story long... I've visited several times and each time I've tried a different bowl. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any order, especially considering how easy it is to customize. The last time I went (and here's where they lose a star), I got their ""favorite"" mongo tacos. When I first looked in my bag, I almost turned around, thinking they forgot to give me two tacos. They're that SMALL. I cracked open the foil to see two tortilla shells. When I finally got home with them, I was shocked! They're so tiny and not anywhere near a full meal. And considering they cost only a little less than a bowl, I thought they were overpriced. Taste was okay, they we're hot. Perhaps I just got a bad batch. The preparer literally did say ""sorry I don't make the tacos often""...k. Cleveland has an amazing taco scene and if you're going to charge that much for tacos at a quick service place, they better be perfection. I would have even been a little happier if they were just stuffed with more veggies. The tacos looked nothing like the pic and were not satisfying. I'd only order again if I had some sort of coupon. 
With that being said, the tacos are my ONLY negative. Staff is super friendly. Place is super clean. Lots of seating and it's in a great location! Parking will be hit or miss if you're driving in.

The brussel sprouts are to die for. I also tried a bowl here, salad as my base, teriyaki bowl, but swapped out the teriyaki sauce for peanut sauce and a green curry, lastly my protein was steak. 

Overall it tasted good, came out quick and fresh, and was plenty of food for me to save half for lunch the next day. The peanut sauce was pretty sweet in my opinion although still good just not expected, but the green curry was deliciously spicy. I was a little disappointed by the steak as it costs extra but it was very small pieces and barely noticeable. Although, I know someone else who had steak tacos and didn't have that experience. 

I had an espresso milk tea no bubbles. It was very good but I was surprised by how sweet it was as the menu doesn't mention a sweetner for that drink.

I knew what to expect, that is why I am giving this place three stars. You know when sometimes for breakfast you get the itch to go order a bunch of donuts even though you should be eating 2 slices of 100% whole wheat bread? It was kind of like that since I hadn't eaten this kind of crap in a while. It fulfilled the indulgence. So, pretty much what I saw were all the American classics like General Tso's chicken, Sweet and Sour pork, beef and broccoli, and some others with some steamed and fried rice. Most of it tasted pretty horrible, as was to be expected, but I rather enjoyed the General Tso's chicken and the fried rice.

It's not the classiest of joints, but what can you really expect for $7.50? The waitress gave pretty good service (she seemed sweet too)

The chef started out in New Orleans and has been making sushi for ten years. He really does an excellent job with the rice, which, believe it or not, is the true backbone to good sushi. It is not too sweet or too sour and is cooked with just the right amount of ""bite"" so that you can actually taste the texture of the grains. They use high quality rice.  

Was pressed for time so had take out. Regular sushi dinner and chicken pad thai along with a rainbow roll. All the sushi was spot on. As I watched the chef, we chatted, and I could tell he was not only skilled, but paid attention to detail in forming the rice and placing the fish. The rice to fish ratio was ideal in the rolls and the sushi. Nothing worse than getting a big honking mound of rice with a tiny piece of fish. The sushi dinner came with miso soup or clear soup (mushrooms and fried onions) and salad. I had the miso. Nicely done. Not too salty. The salad was iceberg (fresh and crispy), but the standard dressing was really good. Nicely in balance. Not sure if they offer a japanese salad. The pad thai was very good. Not drowning in sauce or with a funky color that can just ruin it. Nice balance of fish sauce, sweetness and citrus. Rice noodles where not overcooked and still had some texture too them even though I did not eat until I got home. All the takeout packaging was secure and neatly packaged. Noticed that the menu had hibachi (cooked in the kitchen, not table top), based on my experience with the pad thai, I would try it next time. 

The place is small (six or seven tables? and a small sushi bar, five or six seats?) but nicely decorated and clean. The staff really went out of their way to make me comfortable, answer my questions and point out unique items based on my preferences. All despite the fact that I was just getting take out. And the best part, highly reasonable prices for the quality. The menu is not overwhelming, but they do have a unique selection of rolls and a fair amount of hot food. I would have to assume that if business booms the sushi offerings would expand (they do have almost all the standards plus a few more options for the adventurous). If I could critique one thing, it would be the wasabi. Feel like it could have been firmer and hotter. It was serviceable though. Pickled ginger was pink, not yellow. Standard, but not amazing. I prefer the yellow. 

My take away, Zuki is legit. If my subsequent experiences are as good as my initial one, I will be a regular. I was hesitant to write this review because this place appears to be a hidden gem and it is small. I want to keep it all to myself (and just roll in on a Friday night and actually get a seat), but the food was just too good not to give them the props they deserve. On a price to quality ratio, this place is off the chart.","2017-11-30 14:10:57"

They are originally from Toledo and were looking to expand into other areas. So as I stalked them on Instagram I noticed that they were giving away tickets to try their food out and hang out with King Chip, a local cleveland rapper. I jumped at the chance to win some tickets and luckily I did and my boyfriend and I headed over on a rainy Saturday. Just an FYI they are open for lunch Monday-Friday and will hope to officially open full time after Thanksgiving.

Onto the food!!!!! I ordered a Wiseman bowl that came with wheat noodles, kale, corn, steak, bean sprouts, and a few other veggies and schezuan sauce on the side. You can customize your bowl however you would like and its similar to Chipotle where you pick your carb and protein. It was very tasty and I really liked that they heated the sauce on the side so your not putting a cold sauce on warm noodles. Oh and the steak? AMAZING!!! This is no cheap steak folks. This is quality steak they put in their bowls. My boyfriend ordered the south by southeast tacos and just a warning they are pretty spicy. Still delicious however but if you like heat this is the taco to get. They come with cilantro and some pickled red onion to cool things down a bit. And of course no meal would be complete without bubble tea. They have many varieties here but I recommend you try the strawberry mojito first.

I have to start with the bubble tea. It was delicious. I know some are on the bubble about it, but theirs will change your mind. They have milk, coffee, and fruit based bubble tea. The strawberry is a winner and great for first timers. Being a new facility, of course they are clean. What's even better is that they care about the environment. The containers, drinkware, etc. are either biodegradable, reusable or recyclable. 

Yummy, Yummy!!

Snacks: There is an assortment of snacks. Edamame, beets, wontons, sweet potato salad, nachos, and many more. I would like to introduce you to the best potato salad you haven't tried yet. Sweet Potatoes!! OMG! This salad is both sweet and savory. Bye bye mayonnaise and vinegar dressings, this one is out of this world. It was described by the cashier as being a magical experience. He was right. Every bite was delightful. 

Crispy cream cheese wontons. Excuse me, crispy warm cream cheese wontons. Nothing to explain here. It's a must. The fact that they are warm should make you drive here immediately. I cannot tell you the number of times I have ordered them throughout the city and they are cold. 

You are probably hungry and want to know what the main course is. Tacos and Bowls! Don't frown, they are delicious. You can either choose from their pre-designed bowls or build your own. The vegetables are fresh. I mean, no pesticide taste, no label stickers, no vegetable weirdness. I overheard one of staff members say they would like to start farming their vegetables nearby the Cleveland location. I believe there is a central farm for the Toledo locations. I ordered a steak teriyaki bowl with brown rice. I'm boring. I know. My bowl was anything but boring. The flavors danced in my mouth. I ate half for dinner and the other half for lunch the next day. Balance is nice enough to give you their sauce on the side. You have the power to add as much or little as you like. 

My only dislike is that there is not a fish option. I was truly hoping for one. Otherwise, play around with the bowl and taco choices. Enjoy a tasty meal!","2019-01-27 21:30:59"

Sure, you can customize your order to be healthier; order grilled chicken, skip the bun, and avoid creamy sauces. But all the added sugar and empty calories won't fill you up. With so many fast food chains around the city, it becomes tough to maintain healthy eating habits. Not to worry! Healthy fast food does exist. Next time you need to eat on the run, find yourself a dish at Balance Grille where they serve real food, fast loaded with simple, colorful fresh cut, whole ingredients that are prepared daily. Taste the creative flavors of their mongo tacos, or their Asian-fusion build-a-bowls. Add vegetables, swap sauces, or go for the classic teriyaki like I did. This takeout isn't fried or processed. The food is always fresh, so dig in without a forkful of guilt. If you haven't been to Balance Grille, you're missing out!

Just stopped in for a take out order and was greeted by three friendly staff, one wearing shiny cat ears. I ordered the bang bang chicken tacos, a budda bowl with steak and fried rice, the beet snack, and a purple taro milk. Two staff commented how much they loved the purple taro milk and so did I. I chose almond milk and tapioca bubbles, I only wish I had ordered the large. I never thought I'd write a review for milk, a five star one at that. I had to save some to share with my wife but forgot to tell her about the bubbles, so that was a bit of a shock, sorry hon. So many different varieties of bubble teas I want to try. The budda bowl was delicious and fresh, the sauce was a curry that had a heat that creeps up on you after the initial savory taste. The bang bang taco corn tortilla didn't stand up well to the travel home and would have been better in store nothing remarkable here. But the bang bang sauce was just ok, kind of sweet and tangy. Most surprised that I liked the beets, because I don't like beets, I mean I really don't like beets. But my wife didn't care for them so I tried them and they tasted like they were pickled and a bit minty. Is this swiss chard in here? I'm eating it now. If this were closer to my home or I worked downtown I'd walk here for fast healthy lunch. Variety of proteins makes it very vegan friendly. If you're already downtown check it out but for me to go downtown and park in a garage to primarily go here, probably not gonna happen.

Their focus is on health based dining using sustainable foods put in compostable bowls. Like most chains of this type you start in a line, order your basic which is a bowl, wrap, or salad and work your way from there. You have a choice of white rice, red rice, or white noodles. You then pick your protein which includes tofu if you are vegan. You are allowed 3 vegetables including organic egg for your bowl for free, any additional you pay a slight upcharge. You then can choose a sauce, toppings, fixings and and misc things you wish to garnish it with.

You can then purchase bottled beverages from their refrigerator or you can purchase a drink from the soda fountain where you serve yourself. For dessert you can buy a caramel yum tart or get a box of chips. The prices here are very reasonable.

For my selection I made a salad bowl, topped with chicken, green beans, sauteed vegetables and spicy sesame sauce. For my toppings I added garlic pieces as well as roasted carrots.

You can then either take it out or eat inside a beautiful clean dining area furnished with white booths to sit in. I saw a sign outside that says they now do catering. Outdoor seating is also available. There are also a few TVs inside if you care to see what's on. They also participate in door dash.

This salad was delicious and extremely filling! As a matter of fact they give you so much of it that sometimes you end up having to take it home. One of the staff came over to see how I was doing and I gave him a thumbs up. When I inquired about the soft drinks I learned at this point they don't brew their own ice tea nor sell premade ones. They did have a delicious pomegranate flavored water which I found very enjoyable.

If you go for just the basics then with tax you are probably looking at a little over $10.00 for your bowl. The location is great for movie lovers since it sits to the left of Cinemark in Robinson. It also sits away from Settler's Ridge Giant Eagle Marketplace so you aren't swept away by those shoppers.

This is a welcome addition to Settler's Ridge and gives you an opportunity to enjoy a very filling meal at a very reasonable price.","2019-06-06 19:53:46"

We ventured to the front and admitted it was our first time there and the lady who helped us explained everything to us - included what red rice was and how it differs from regular rice ( tastes similar but more nutrients).  Check box number two - friendly and helpful staff.  

I did the bowl with teriyaki chicken and had green beans / steamed veggies and broccoli and mushrooms added - got to sauces and she recommended the teriyaki and garlic yum (even let me sample) and ... sold!   You can add carrots , cucumbers and onions at no charge but if you want the guacamole there is an extra charge.  I added garlic chips and sesame seeds as well.  Figured we would try the chips and salsa since we were there :)  

All in all - the food was tasty. I think I will pass on the garlic chips next time - little to overpowering for me.  The chips were good as well - I personally was not a fan of the salsa but the rest of my group like it .. check box three. 

While we were there. - two separate people came around to check to make sure we were ok ... keep the up ... no matter how busy you get - means a lot even if you don't need anything....check box four.

The set up of this is very similar to Chipotle - pick a base (rice, noodles, tortilla), a meat, veggies, and sauce.  So far I've tried the tofu and chicken... I prefer the tofu.  You get 3 veggie options per order.  The veggies are green beans, summer veggies, egg (not a veg, but an option), black beans, kale, and I think some other items that I can't remember.  They're a bit overcooked, but flavorful.  

After veggies, you pick a sauce and a topper.  I like the ginger yum sauce or teriyaki.  For toppers, I don't recommend the guacamole... It always looks brown and nasty... But there are other choices to finish your dish.

The three sauce selections of Sassy Me, Four Star and Thai Guy seemed to be a good fit for all with Sassy Me taking the lead.

I asked guests which bowls were the favorite and the majority said that they did not make a specific style of bowl but added a little of everything from the buffet.
 
The amazing snack choice of warm, creamy wontons and citrus Brussel sprouts became a main dish for many who went back for more and more til gone! The citrus glaze Brussel sprouts were perfectly soft-crunchy, with crispy edges and so flavorful and was the first tray to be emptied.
 
I ordered for 20 and had 14 guests who gave immediate compliments.  There was plenty of food and I am confident that everyone went back for more until the trays were emptied.

Balance is a new, healthy spot in Downtown Cleveland for highly customizable tacos, salads and bowls. You choose the starch, protein and sauce. The staff is also super friendly and always quick to offer recommendations. Because its so customizable its effortlessly gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian friendly!

The bowl is so huge and fresh that I use but a few drops of the sauce and I never feel guilty afterwards.

Many of the nearby restaurants focus on heavy, meaty, bar food, which I also love (especially with a cold IPA) but they leave you feeling tired by the time you make it to the game or show.  At Balance you can choose between healthy, hearty or both!  The prices are fair for the portions and they definitely don't skimp on flavor.

All the snacks are amazing.  My two personal favorites are the citrus brussel sprouts and the bangbang nachos.  The citrus brussels are crispy and the bangbang sauce could make a shoe taste good. My bronze medal snack would be the sweet potato salad because the sweet soy glaze gives it such a lasting punch.

For larger appetites any of the bowls work.  My favorite is the wiseman with chicken on greens because of the spicy Szechuan sauce (add a little bangbang sauce to kick it up a notch), but the tacos are better than the bowls and will keep me coming back.  I am a chicken taco lover so I enjoy getting a 3 pack of the SxSE, BangBang and SoHo tacos, but truth be told I can't get enough of the BangBang and SxSe.  

I know my review reads like a bangbang sauce billboard but trust me the menu has much more.  There are variations on Thai, Korean, even Indian flavors in addition to the normal Chinese -American styles you find around. Plus I love being able to see all my ingredients from prep to cook.  It doesn't get much fresher than that. 

If you want a flavorful healthy meal downtown swing by balance.  I bet you leave with a full stomach, a bag of leftovers and some energy to take on the night instead of taking a nap.

I'm so grateful to come close to some sort of Asian bakery... Previously, the only options were day- or week- old pastries from Chicago sold in the local Asian marts... :(

Asian sweet bakery is NOT just a bakery, you can get typical chinese food as well. Indeed, when I visit again, it would be mainly for the breakfast food, not the baked goods. The owner and cashier is chinese, and speak chinese and cantonese. I would describe this Asian style as mainly cantonese, due to the presence of congee, sweet top (what I call pineapple bun) and sesame balls.

What's good:
Congee with pork
Fried dough stick (almost as good as in Asia)
Sweet top bun (no filling)
Crepes (decent)

Don't bother:
Sesame ball (too much dough, weird custard filling inside)
Egg tarts (too sweet)
Beef brisket noodles (no flavor in the soup or beef :|) 

I think they still have improvement for baked goods, but overall I enjoy the congee and fried dough stick, a typical breakfast food in Hong Kong or Asia. Also, the sweet top buns are a treat! I love to heat them up at home, and put in a thick slab of butter after heating the buns! LOVE IT!

They immediately brought us water, but it took a while to get service. We did finally get a server and tried to order drinks. They don't have a liquor license so they had complimentary wine and beer. They were out of beer and only had Moscato for wine. Moscato is too sweet for me so I stuck with the water.

We ordered and all our food was good, but our service was just bizarre. Every time we asked a question we were met with weird answers or he would say yes, I'm just about to get that when clearly he'd just forgotten.

The most bizarre part was when our friend ordered a California roll and he recommended upgrading to the Flipped Roll which is a roll with mango on top. It really wasn't similar to the California roll at all?

My favorite thing is to order a pork rib crepe (the sauce is delicious, and the meat is so tender) with Chinese century egg and pork congee with a cup of fresh-made, hot soy milk. Makes me feel right at home and so, so delicious!

They also have a wonderful assortment of bakery items - from BBQ pork buns to mochi, coconut toasted buns to sesame balls, this place can definitely satisfy your sweet cravings. Make sure to come early to order egg tarts because they sell out fast!

The restaurant itself is small and simple inside. Things are also served on a paper plate with disposal utensils, which kind of sucks but is also pretty accurate to how some things are served in Asia haha.

So I came here with my friend and I was a little nervous because I wasn't familiar with the setup but quickly realized it's similar to Chipotle or Subway. So I go up to order my ""wrap"" (it's a burrito) and two people were behind me in line which made me want to rush. I got my meat, none of the vegetables looked appealing and then I got guacamole and cheese. When we got to the meat the guy asked me if that was enough. Confused, I said ""I guess, yeah."" The reason I was I confused is because at Chipotle they give you a set amount of meat and if you want more you pay extra so I'm not used to being asked if that's enough. I pay my $10 for my ""wrap"" and a fountain drink and I sit down and rip it in half so I can eat it easier and... it's the saddest little burrito you've ever seen. There's no heft/bulk to this thing at all. I turned to my friend and said ""I wish this had rice or something."" He pointed to the menu and showed me rice is an option. Now I'll admit, this was my fault for rushing. *I* missed the rice. I wasn't asked if I wanted rice but I also didn't see it. So despite normally being too anxious/afraid to go back up and ask for something else, I did. I went up and said ""I'm sorry, can I get a side of rice? I missed it when I was up here."" My plan was to stuff the rice into the burrito myself. The guy told me to bring my burrito back but I was trying not to be difficult and I said ""I already ripped it in half"" and his response was ""I don't give a shit."" ...This was where I started getting anxious/uncomfortable - was he mad at me? I couldn't tell. So I went and grabbed my burrito and he took it from me and said ""I don't normally do this"" and in my head I was thinking, I didn't ask you to do this. I just wanted some rice! So he steams a new tortilla and dumps the contents of my previous ""wrap"" onto the new tortilla and grabs some kind of pink rice. I wanted white rice but at this point I am NOT asking for anything else. I already feel like this guy is mad at me. He adds a little extra meat and cheese which was nice of him but then he said a second time ""I don't normally do this"" which is where I started to get angry. I didn't ask you to do this, sir! & do what, exactly? Give me food that I paid for? I've worked in food before so I always try to be extra polite to food workers and I know I was polite, apologized and blamed myself when I asked for some rice so... I don't understand why it was such a production. Also I waited for the two people behind me to be done and there was no one else in line so I wasn't holding anyone up. I just wanted some rice, man.

The food was actually really good but I'm waiting at least a few months before I go back so hopefully that guy won't recognize me.","2019-11-24 19:58:47"

I was needing some General Tso's and other Americanized Chinese fare for lunch.  Having already tried one place downtown and coming up short I figured I'd give Golden Palace a try.  Fail.  Golden Palace's buffet is on a table that measures 15' x 3' and doesn't offer much variety.  This would make me think the limited choices make for better food.  Wrong.
The food housed on this small table is not fresh, is not tasty, and is not appealing.  I was almost tempted to just ask for my money back.  Instead I rolled the dice and tried the General Tso's, the fried rice, and the chicken and peppers.

After my Harness Cycle class, I went just across the street to Balance Pan-Asian Grille for lunch. While the line was long, due to the number of businesspeople who were also hungry for food, it passed by super quickly, and I was able to get my order within 5 minutes of speaking with the cashier person.

The concept is pretty simple - choice of sauce and veggies, protein, and carb. Normally, when I order at restaurants like this, I ask for the sauce to be on the side. But Balance Pan-Asian Grille already pre-packs their sauces in separate containers, which is nice. All in all, the food was pretty decent, not to mention the restaurant is kept so clean. The only major criticism I had about the place is that the flavors don't really mesh together. Essentially, I got a heap of vegetables, some chicken on the bottom, and sauce for dipping/drizzling on top of everything.

I had been looking forward to trying this Asian Mexican fusion experience for far too long. Well, weird part of Indiana, you won't hold a girl back too long upon her return to the Buckeye State. My boyfriend and I decided to hit it up shortly after the event... after all, the raves of my fellow Elites really sent me spinning with jealousy. Blasphemy, you lucky consumers of fresh delicious food!

The girl at the counter was above and beyond any type of ""cashier"" I had ever had. Absolutely charismatic, made us feel like we were family, and truly hosted the entire experience as if it was a tour of our taste buds. So many kudos Emily! You were funny, kind and a fantastic employee. They are lucky to have you!

So here we are, with choices galore, and not exactly sure what direction to go... but my greens loving machine of a bod (this is a joke because I love cheese far more than greens, but on this particular night I was feeling the freshest) steered us towards edamame and brussel sprouts to start. There. Could. Not. Have. Been. Anything. Better. You guys - whatever citrus glaze they marinate those sprouts in really took me on a ride. They were piping hot, the absolutely perfect amount of crunch to soft and flaky ratio, and legittttt the sauce melted in your mouth. I was done right there. I could have eaten two helpings of brussels and never tried another thing on the menu and been a regular forevermore.  Well, as luck would have it, eating purely starter veggies wasn't in the cards. The edamame was absolutely fantastic too, by the way. The little carton it came in truly seemed to be endless. A smidge too much salt for my liking but I just brushed it off. The temperature and texture of the edamame was what really mattered.

We tried the Bang Bang tacos on blue corn as well as a General Tso's bowl. Holy mother of god are they not joking when they say Bang Bang is ""spicy"" - y'all, this isn't your Bang Bang Shrimp from Bonefish Grille kind of spicy. No slight sriracha infused mayo up in this joint. This was straight burning your lips sizzzzzzllllleee. I mean, I liked it, but even as a spice lover, I could only do so much. I almost think I'd rather put the sauce on the side and apply for myself. Nevertheless, be careful on these things!

The bowl was perfectly fresh and the meat was tender... tasty rice and crunchy veggies. Who can ask for more?!

I usually get the sushi combo but one of these days I'm going to pick an adorable bento box!  You can pick 2 or 3 smaller maki rolls for $10-13.  Like I said before, you also get the soup and salad to start.

My last visit I chose the Alaskan Dream special roll and purchased a house salad.  The menu salad is much larger than the one they provide with the combo.  The roll itself was 10 pieces and the flavor was average.  There were panko crumbs in the center and I found a couple really hard inedible pieces.  I simply set them to the side and continued eating, but it's something I'll consider in the future when an item has panko.

The the General Manager, Matt, and the Kitchen Manager, Matt (who goes by Bing), came right over to greet me warmly and asked if I had any questions.
I didn't, because the signs above the food bar clearly state how to order. First you pick your base, such as rice noodles, red rice, or white rice. Then you pick your protein (chicken, tofu or steak). Finally, you pick vegetables and accoutrements to top it off. Bing asked me what I'd like. I don't have allergies and I'm not a picky eater so I said surprise me. He grinned. ""Great! I'll give you my favorite!"" and he loaded my bowl with rice noodles, grilled chicken, sauteed vegetables, green beans, chipotle sauce, corn, and at my request, a tiny bit of shredded cheese and some fresh,  red onion. As he handed it to me, I wondered if my medical covered a hernia. The bowl was brimming with delicious-looking, fresh and colorful food, and was heavy.

I dropped my bowl off at a gleaming black, polished marble top table in a booth, and headed to the drink station, directly across from the entrance. They have water, Sobe Pomegranate Yumberry, Mountain Dew, Raspberry ice tea, and 1 or 2 others. I had Raspberry ice tea, then the Sobe Pomegranate Yumberry, which has long been a favorite of mine.

There's a long row of counter seating along the front window, 4 high tops (tables), and about 6 or so, large, comfy booths.
Matt, the GM, checked on me. All good. 
Then his manager, Gary, came over and talked when I was finished. He said he had open a lot of restaurants, including Blaze Pizza across the way, both here, West Virginia, and in California. He explained that though this was fast casual, the company is very committed to healthy fare. The eggs are cage-free. All their chicken and steak are hormone and antibiotic-free. The vegetables are fresh. I was impressed that the vegetables, especially the onions and zucchini, were not overcooked. The chunks of chicken and noodles were perfect, and Bing used just enough Chipotle sauce for a zingy-spicy kick. I'm dying to try a bowl with red rice, tofu, and vegetables, with ginger yum sauce next time. Turns out that's Bing's second favorite. 

I ordered dessert to go, a Yum Tart, which looked like a mini tart. Bing told me the ingredients,  but he had me at caramel. The top was artfully decorated in a latte-like swirl. It was so good, it never made it to my car (Hey, I'm not proud. Just honest).

There's only 2 reasons why I deducted a star. They have a very limited beverage selection. Personally, I try to limit my sugar  (No health issues. A lower sugar diet makes me feel better, and keeps my 5'1"" frame looking good). I already had figured in dessert, so I was hoping for ice tea. Also, I don't drink soda anymore, and usually have ice tea.

The other reason was the dining room is boring. It's stark, sleek, and functional. The ""art"" is limited to the huge posters explaining the company's name, commitment to healthy eating and to the environment. Nothing on the tables. A vase of flowers, a candle, or floating candle would be a nice touch, giving it a warm atmosphere.

I guess when you have employees from the very top on down, that are warm and friendly and have a true passion for their jobs, it does take the edge off the stark dining room.","2019-06-05 00:01:13"

"T9xM4YLVxnvlpmJzBZA01g","FPJeHxXmXA2-wgsaguFuKw","K1GMWMm_BfG_0ew_PtMnhA",4,2,0,1,"SHORT VERSION: Balance Pan-Asian Grille is a well thought out, much needed, fresh and healthy concept for the Euclid corridor. A few small tweaks, and this might be the best fast, casual lunch in all of downtown Cleveland. 

LONG VERSION: They have a beautiful, open, contemporary design, with large, floor to ceiling windows along the front of the parcel. Once you enter, it's just as open and well put together inside. Clean, crisp, and still felt shiny and new, even after being open almost a full year. Immediately upon entering, you see a sign directing you to the right for placing and order, and to the left for online/pickup. 

We made our way to the right where they had three large LED screens with the menu. It was a little awkward, as you really had to look almost straight up by the time you reached the front of the line. We made our choices and proceeded to the counter to place our order. Another little flaw was the menu screens I mentioned earlier are actually behind you and to the right once you actually place your order. So I had to turn around and glance over the people in line behind us, apologizing as I felt like I was holding things up a bit. 

I decided on a sweet and sour bowl, with brown rice for the starch, and grilled steak for the protein. I also ordered some creamy wontons, and a taro milk tea with tapioca pearls. 

Like I mentioned, they had a TON of drink options (milk tea, bubble tea, iced tea, frozen tea, fancy bottled waters, and a few random ""high end"" cans/bottles in a grab n' go cooler at the order counter.) The one thing I did find a little odd, was that you couldn't just order a good old Diet Coke, either on the fountain or in a bottle. While a $6 bubble tea was fine once, I'd prefer a more economical soda option if I was making regular visits. The vibe I got from this place however, is that soda is probably considered ""bad"". Which, let's be honest, it mostly is; but it's still vastly popular. 

Once we had our order placed, we grabbed a seat and waited 4-5 minutes until they called my name and we returned to the window to grab lunch. It was served on a chic little wooden tray, perfectly holding two bowls, a side, a few sauces, and a drink. 

My bowl had kale, red onions and carrots, with a base of brown rice and wok-fried steak. It came with a traditional sweet and sour sauce (the red gooey, sweet sauce you've been getting with your Chinese takeout for years). Everything went well together, with the sweetness of the sauce mixing with the savory of the steak, while getting that crunchy mouth feel from the kale and carrots. Admittedly, I'm more of a ""meat and potatoes"" kind of guy, but this still was something I'd happily order again. For being fast, and healthy, it was surprisingly filling.

That also may have been aided by the creamy wontons (four in the order, deep fried with a side of the same sweet and sour sauce) and the taro milk tea I had with my meal. The tea, was similar to those I've gotten elsewhere. Mixed in a plastic cup after a cellophane lid is applied, you stab the top with your oversized straw, and enjoy the beverage. I would have preferred a little ice, but wasn't given the option. I think next time I'll ask, only because something as overly sweet as a bubble tea needs to stay chilled in my opinion, or it becomes almost too sweet once it comes to room temp.

As pricing goes, it's right on par with what you'd expect at a downtown fast/casual. I believe the bowl was $8.50 with a .50 up-charge for the steak. The wontons were $4 and the bubble tea ended up being $6 for a small. I think there was an up-charge for almond milk, but they didn't mention it. One of my little pet peeves is up-charge items not being mentioned upon ordering. 

The only thing negative I have to say about this place, and I don't even think negative is the right word... is the layout of the dining room. We were sat fairly close to the pickup window, and about halfway through our meal, there were so many people standing around waiting for their order, that they were almost in my lap. There didn't seem to be any kind of method to the madness, as bodies were basically just everywhere. It kind of reminded me of waiting on the subway in New York. It wasn't a huge deal, but had we been wanting to talk, or go over business stuff, it would have been next to impossible. Again, that's probably on me for expecting space and relative quiet at noon on a busy weekday lunch rush. 

Overall, Balance has a really good vibe, with an equally good presentation and taste. If I worked nearby, I'd probably end up being there at least once a week, if not more. I love to see a new concept downtown, especially one that brings healthy options with it. I like breweries and bbq as much as the next guy, but sometimes you just want to eat something that satisfies your hunger, without that ""blah"" feeling an hour later. Balance certainly checks off that box, and does it in style.","2019-10-05 05:04:53"

I have eaten sushi and hibachi steak teriyaki at many places and never have I had such awful food. The steak teriyaki, fried rice, noodles and vegetables had an awful taste that I couldn't identify (not a spice, no idea what it was). It was so strong and nasty that it made the entire meal inedible (even with soy sauce added to it). The ""steak"" actually looked like boiled chunks of a cheap cut of meat. It was definitely NOT stir fried. The ""fried"" rice was definitely not fried, it was steamed and sitting in the watery liquid from the meat (so were the noodles and vegetables). I literally felt sick and disgusting after attempting to eat my meal. I never should have accepted the meal and paid for it. What a complete waste of money and time. My Friday night was ruined.

The food here can be compared to Chipotle, Piada Italian steet food, or Bibibop asian grill. The price here is a bit high for lunch ($8.50) for a bowl so the price here is similar to Piada. Chipotle and Bibibop are definitely a bit cheaper. You also can't really compare this place to Chipotle because you actually get vegetables here with your meal and you don't really at Chipotle except for corn and lettuce.

CASUAL RESTAURANT -- You order at the counter and wait for your order to be called out (similar to the other restaurants I mentioned above - Chipotle, etc).

LUNCH -- Delicious. I was very full after eating. I ordered the Wiseman bowl which comes with vegetables, your choice of protein (tofu, lentils, chicken, or steak) and your choice of a carb/starch base (brown rice, vegetables, etc). 

I got my bowl with brown rice and chicken. The vegetables in the Wiseman bowl are shredded carrots, corn, broccoli, kale, and bean sprouts. The szechuan sauce is what really completed the meal. It is basically soy sauce but has a slight sweetness to it. It is the perfect blend of sweet, spicy, and savoury. The sauce isn't spicy at all, at least for my taste buds because I love spicy foods.

DRINKS -- They sell traditional drinks (water and soft drinks or soda pop) but they have bubble tea. I didn't buy a bubble tea when I visited so I'll have to come back again a second time to try one. The have milk teas which you can get vegan by choosing Almond Milk. They also have iced-teas.

SERVICE -- Service was awesome. I was greeted when I entered and the menu was explained to me.

Overall, I recommend coming here for lunch. There are options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. 

P.S. Order your lunch in advance during the week. I was told that they get very busy during the weekday (Mon. - Fri.) during the hours of 11am - 2pm, so lunch hours. I visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was very quiet. The guy behind the cashier told me that they are not busy at all on Saturdays and they are closed on Sundays. It's sad that this area of downtown doesn't get much visitors who want to eat or shop at the surrounding arcade building especially since the always popular 4th street gets very busy on weekends. I believe with the new apartment building being built in this part of downtown then perhaps more locals will stop by here to eat.

I like this take on quick fresh food because I'm a fan of the Asian wok stir fry inside the Market District, which is in the same plaza, and wanted to see if this was similar. It is, but my main suggestion would be to keep the focus on the Asian aspects. They had options to go more Mexican like Chipotle, with black beans and salsas and whatnot. But the overall vibe was Asian, so that was a little confusing Like they're not sure which direction to take. But I guess I get it, they can cover both markets this way. 

I stayed Asian and got a chicken bowl with red rice, eggs, Asian green beans, zucchini, sesame seeds, and teriyaki sauce. The server was not shy on any of the ingredients and I ended up with a whopping bowl. We added chips and salsa and while the chips were a little greasy, they reminded me of the wonton chips at one of my fave Chinese sit down restaurants from my childhood that closed down years ago. BUT I don't feel like the salsa went. Again, it was Mexican style and not Asian. I think a duck sauce type dipping sauce would go waaay better. Left full with over half of my bowl and it heated up great for leftovers. Would stop by again, I think this place will stick around when people catch wind of it!

I like Balance, I think it serves a really big need in this area which is quick and reliable take out that isn't junky or your standard club sandwich. What I really have to praise Balance for though is their app. Not their appetizers mind you, but the phone application they offer. Normally, I'm the type of person who disdains apps. Just more junk cluttering up my phone, annoying notifications, and difficult to navigate to the point where you just give up and place the order on the phone (or wait, is that just me? Am I getting that antiquated?). In any case, Balance's app is very easy to navigate, only gives notifications to let you know your food is ready, and it's very similar to Chipotle's app interface in terms of the ability to modify orders and repeat previous orders. Also, they offer rewards points though the app, which are very easy to accrue and can be used towards free menu items. 

The food is pretty tasty. The first time I ate here, I got one of the bowls with the whole wheat noodles and I thought they were incredibly delicious. I suspect they coat them with oil and that's why they are so good, but I appreciate that their sauces are all served on the side. The sauces themselves, to be honest, aren't my favorite, most of them are really overly sweet, yet their bang bang sauce I'm told is crazy spicy. I wish they had more variety in the sauces, or at least better explanations of the flavor profiles. One thing I want to mention too is that their bowls are served with the base (rice, noodles, salad greens) and then the steamed veggies on top. I personally love that the veggies are really bright and still crisp, but some might feel that they are borderline raw. The red onions for example are nearly raw, as are the bell peppers. Again, I enjoy this, but it might put off some people that prefer their veggies to be softer and have less of that raw taste. They have a ton of options for bubble teas, most of them are pretty sweet and artificial tasting to me, but I like that you can customize the sweetness when you order, and they also offer both oolong and green tea plain/unsweetened if you prefer. 

Where this place really excels is in their process. When ordering through the app, you can set your pickup time, go straight to the pickup section and there's always a staff member there making sure your order is ready to go and paired with the proper drink. Since you can pay through the app, you can be in and out in just minutes, making it super convenient for those days when you really don't have time to stand around and wait for your lunch. For that reason, I think Balance is a great fit for this area of downtown, and I think I'll end up visiting here quite often.","2019-08-30 13:34:51"

I had the fish congee. I added the vinegar and soy sauce for some flavor. I wish they offered a bit more seasonings like green onions and fish sauce.  Make sure if you want potstickers with the combo that you order it. I didn't realize you can also order the congee a la carte and was too full to even bother ordering the potstickers.

I tried the wonton and potsticker soup. There is also cabbage so I wasn't a fan of the cabbage broth.

The concept is a lot like what you would expect of a Chipotle:  bowl, salad, or wrap, and then a base (white rice, red rice, or noodles), next is the protein (which determines the price), vegetables, and sauces (I LOVE the garlic yum).

They also have a few tables outside which is great for that area too!   

My only suggestion/change would be for the chips; if they were more of a dessert based item, I think they would be great (serve them in a container, drizzle them with caramel and powdered sugar), but I know being a chain I don't think there's a lot of flexibility with choices there.

You can choose from wraps, bowls, and salads. From there, you choose a protein, vegetables, sauces, and extras. I'm a little confused about the option of chips and salsa, but I'm not complaining. I will say if you like yum yum sauce from hibachi places, you'll LOVE this place because they serve various types of yum yum sauces to top everything off (the garlic yum tastes most like it). They even have some really tasty fruity looking drink options like blue raspberry lemonade by the pop machines. 

The options are super cheap, and you get a lot of food to fill you up. I paid about $8 for my chicken bowl, and I could've made two meals out of it if I wanted to. I didn't want to though because the yum yum sauce was too good. Great, friendly staff here too. The manager (I believe) came outside to make sure our food was alright, and for a chain, that's respectable to me.

Additionally, at the moment there is a lot of construction going on near the restaurant, so finding the entrance was a challenge. 

We were welcomed warmly when we entered and given a brief overview of how the menu works. I recommend just grabbing the paper copy because it may take a minute to figure everything out if you have never been. I was really intrigued by the tacos, but decided to get a bowl since that is their main attraction. I ordered the teriyaki bowl with chicken breast (added cost, the standard chicken is thigh meat) over greens I also ordered the pickled beets and collards. My friend ordered the wiseman bowl with chicken thighs and rice. The woman taking our order was super friendly and personable, like the rest of the staff, and was kind enough to offer us free cups of water and suggestions while ordering. She also asked if we were dining together, so that our orders would come on the same tray, which was great.

The aesthetic inside is awesome, there is a very clean and modern feel and tons of fresh plants. (There were also iphone chargers at some of the tables, so cool!) 

The food was incredibly fresh and I was so happy to see the sauce comes on the side so you can add to your liking. Honestly the chicken was really special which sounds weird- but normally at fast-casual restaurants such as these, I always feel like the protein tastes like it came out of a microwave. This tasted fresh off the grill. The pickled beets I ended up adding to my bowl and were delightful. I will definitely be back at some point.

So this must not be in an isolated incident since they have a canned response to tell customers.  Thank you for the last meal I will ever have at sesame inn.

So my friend and I are scoping out all the Chinese restaurants in Madison, and this one was not impressive. Although it looked promising when we arrived because of how many people were here, we quickly learned the truth. This place ... is whack. I ordered my go to - cashew chicken - and my friend ordered one of her go to's - fried rice with beef - and we were both NOT impressed. Second bite into my chicken, and it's HARD. Like BONE hard. Eew. And my friend's fried rice had so much egg in it, it took up a quarter of her plate after picking the egg out of a third of her dish. Like, we know protein is important, but there are other food groups too, ya know? The best parts of my cashew chicken were the cashews and the white rice - which if you don't know - are impossible to mess up. So we wait for our bill, like forever, and when we finally get it, there are our fortune cookies! I open mine, and it has the fortune sticking out, and she opens hers, and BOOM. No fortune. That's like the whole reason we're doing this. We love those fortunes. Disappointment. Wah. Anyway. The chicken was bad quality, I've had much better. The pieces that weren't hard were dark meat - very spongy. But they fill up that soy sauce bottle real good, because we used over half of it, so that's a plus. Prices weren't bad either. Overall, we decided not to come back.","2014-10-12 00:52:24"

I started with a bowl of hot and sour soup which was very good. Some places make theirs too sweet and others make it too hot. This was the perfect balance of both. As my entree I got the sesame chicken which I wasn't all that impressed with but that is only because I'm not a huge fan of dark meat. I did however try my friends amazing chicken and the name is very fitting. The amazing chicken had just the right amount of breaking. It was not loaded with fried breaking like a lot of other Chinese places. It was also made with white meat which I like a lot better. The only complaint I would have is the price. It is about double the price of your local Chinese restaurant so be prepared to spend $15-20 on a entree.

It's not a stereotypical hole in the wall take out place, and it's not the lame-imitation of PF Chang's either...it's genuine Chinese food in a nice restaurant. 

The lunch menu for the Inn is good, but you would be better served dropping by for dinner--that's when they break out the really good stuff. Featured on their menu is: the ""amazing"" chicken, Peking duck, half-moon duck, some other kind of duck, lots of other kinds of chicken, plenty of rice dishes, lamb, and all sorts of other dishes that I haven't tried yet, including a ""taste of Thai"" menu, and some sushi. So far, everything that I HAVE tried has been delicious.

Besides the main entrees, there are several good appetizers, including vegan ones, soups and salads, and the very excellent salt-and-pepper bean curd. The desserts are decent too.

The look of the place is amazing! It's a wide open restaurant with plenty of space, and a very zen kind of ambiance. The lobby is visually exciting as well. Every time I eat there, I feel very calm, which probably has something to do with the super-chill music they play--you know that twangy, ubiquitous music that seems to play in basically every store and restaurant these days? yeah, they don't play that here, so you can actually enjoy your food =]

The restaurant had plenty of parking in their private lot, so I didn't have trouble there.

I have eaten food from the Sesame Inn before but have never actually been to the restaurant.  We arrived at around 11:40 to find both sets of doors open and proceeded to head into the restaurant.  Once there we were greeted by the hostess who told us that the restaurant did not open until noon.  Since we were already there we decided to wait out in the lobby/sunroom type area.  It was actually quite a nice area that was decorated brightly with plants and some spacious seats.  At around 11:50 we were told that they were now ready for us and that we could sit inside.  The inside of the restaurant is just as nice as the lobby area was and had some large windows, birds of paradise flowers and some nice decorating.  The lights seemed to be embedded in what looked like large umbrellas and I thought that it gave the restaurant a nice feel.

For my entr¨¦e I decided to go with the Mongolian Chicken, extra spicy.  Since it was Sunday, there was also a brunch option on the menu which gave the option of 4 popular dishes that would also be served with soup, salad or egg roll, the entr¨¦e and a soft drink (no free refills on them if received from brunch).  Everyone else at the table ordered a brunch menu item except for me and within a short time there were all served their egg rolls and soup.  Thankfully for me, my cousin is not a big fan of soup and so I was able to get him to order hot and sour soup for me.  The soup came out hot, was very tasty and I enjoyed it.  I have to admit that I was pretty jealous of the egg rolls that everyone else got as well as they were absolutely humongous.  After everyone had finished the starters our meals came out.  They served the white rice accompaniment family style in a huge bowl.  My Mongolian Chicken came with bamboo shoots, scallion, onion and dried hot peppers all mixed together.  The chicken was moist and tasted pretty good and I was happy that they made it my dish fairly spicy like I had asked.  I ended up added a little rice to the dish and by the time I was finished eating I was completely stuffed.

The bottom line for me is that I would head to the Sesame Inn again in the future.  It costs a bit more than some of the Chinese restaurants in the area but you are paying for the quality.  This was easily seen in the size and stuffing of the egg rolls and also in the wonton soup which had a decent amount of scallions and thin strips of pork in it.","2013-06-04 00:23:15"

We went early on a Friday evening.  There were still several tables empty but the hostess took a bit of time deciding where to seat us.  I'm not sure if they take reservations but perhaps some of the tables were reserved and they just didn't mark them.

I enjoy that the menu has both sushi and chinese items.  I love sushi and was excited to order a roll as an appetizer.  I had the spicy tuna and my husband had a california roll.  Both were decent.  Not the best sushi I've ever had, but the fish seemed fresh and there was a lot of flavor.

It was tough trying to decide which entree to get since there were so many choices.  I had the Bride and Groom dish.  I enjoyed the flavor but I disliked the size and texture of the meat pieces.  They were pretty large and not that easy to cut or chew.  Not something I'd order again.

Overall a decent meal, but not a place I would go out of my way to return to.","2014-06-16 20:03:22"

Once you learn what they do well (General Tso's chicken, the duck dishes, lo mein, teriyaki chicken, shrimp egg rolls, steamed and fried dumplings) and what they do not-so-well (won ton soup, fried rice, regular egg rolls)*, you can have a pretty consistently good experience with them.  Online ordering makes things a lot easier, the delivery folks are polite and arrive within the estimated time, and the food is pretty good.  Also, one night we ordered a little close to closing time and arrived a few minutes late to pick it up, and they were very nice about sticking around for us.  

I wish I could give it a less lukewarm endorsement, but going from the Asian food of San Francisco, CA to that of Swissvale, PA has been a little bit jarring.  All in all, no major complaints; it's great to have a dependable Saturday-night-in staple for the fiance and I.

There were 7 of us so I called & made reservations- we walked in at 3:55 and were promptly seated at a table set up & waiting for us.  Our waitress brought over menus (I hate when they are already placed on the table before you even get there).  As we were looking it over, a server came around with 2 pots of the complimentary tea and filled our water glasses.  We ordered after a few minutes and sat back & waited...  In probably less than 5 minutes, out come our egg rolls and the Octopus salad we ordered as apps.  The egg rolls were cooked to perfection- the outer shell was as delicate as a spring roll and the inside vegetables still had that crunch.  The chicken egg rolls were devoured before I could get a good look but we ordered another one so they must have been pretty good.  It was me that had ordered the octopus salad and while it wasn't prepared the way I was used to- slightly pickled, left in bigger pieces- this was still nice & fresh octopus with crunchy veggie strings interspersed in a subtle cream type sauce.  That was my only :( in the whole meal and who am I to tell them how to prepare octopus salad...?  

Our entrees came out & they were huge.  My wife ordered Happy Family, I ordered Vegetable Lo Mein (we normally share 2 plates), my dad (who has a very limited grasp on oriental cuisine) played it safe with chicken strips & white rice,my mo ordered Amazing Chicken and my sons ordered Amazing Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein & General Tso's Shrimp.  The Amazing Chicken was my fav of the day.  It had the most delicate breading on it with a slight tangy sauce (reminded me of General Tso's sweetness mixed with the tanginess of Duck Sauce).  There wasn't a single sliver of amazing chicken to put into a to go box.  We ended up splitting our (my wife & mine) leftovers and made 2 work lunches.  

Then at the end of our meal, because I had told the waitress we were celebrating my son's b/d, she brought out a comp. piece of cheesecake with a candle on it and started the Happy Birthday song.  She didn't have to, but that was a very nice touch on their part.  

We've been to a bunch of Chinese restaurants in the area and I think this one gets my vote as the best.  Even over P. F. Changs who some people thing is awesome, my experience is that their food is 'boil-in-a-bag' and pour out onto your plate.  Their sweet & sour chicken was cold & mushy...

First off, the hostess was adorable and incredibly sweet. The bartender was amazing and he made us feel right at home. And the owner of the restaurant seemed like the sweetest lady in the world. The decor was what I would expect from a Chinese restaurant but they made the restaurant feel classy and not cheap.

I ordered the pepper steak no tomatoes and my boyfriend got pork egg foo young. Wow is all I can say. The beef actually tasted like real fresh meat! Not the rubber fake kind you get at other cheap takeouts. The only draw back i had was that the peppers and onions were cut pretty big but that wasn't a huge issue. My boyfriends egg foo young was like none other and they sure didn't hold back on the sauce! The pork inside was actually Chinese bbq pork and it sure added a kick.

The Amazing Duo was somewhat enjoyable but still wasn't as sweet as I would have liked and some of the chicken was rubbery. 

The Kung Pao Duo was very, very bland. It wasn't spicy, and it wasn't savory or flavorful, even though it had celery, peanuts, and mushrooms in it. By the way, it had way too much peanuts and celery. These are supposed to complement this dish, not be a main component. I would have told the waiter about the taste, but I had started eating my wife's meal first before and he came over to check on us before I had mine. I ate a little bit of mine over the course of the night, but my wife and I practically finished hers. I told the waiter at the end of the meal how bland mine was while he was packing it up. He went and had the cook ""spice""  it up before putting it into the to go box. Trying it at home, it's still bland and maybe spiced from a 0 to a 1 lol. The waiter did give us free white rice to take home to eat with our leftovers. 

All in all, I would not eat here again, especially for the price ($18 per meal dinner) and lack of taste and quality. I would rather spend my money at Nikkis Thai Kitchen (yes, it's not Chinese, but the quality is outstanding and it's a favorite restaurant of mine.)","2018-02-16 01:15:06"

Ordered with coworkers for dinner tonight and was satisfied and underwhelmed all in one, if that's possible.  

For the satisfied part, I was surprised by the amount of food I received.  I order the General Tso's (old reliable) combination plate.  Unlike other places when you order and combo plate you get soup and an egg roll on top of the entree.  To me, soup from a Chinese restaurant is nothing more than a tea with food in it.  The egg roll was surprisingly good.  I think they may have mistakenly gave me a shrimp egg roll instead of the run of the mill regular egg roll (not complaining there).  As for the entree, their ""small portion"" was that of any other place; read - not small.

As for the underwhelming aspect of the food, the fried rice may have been fried a bit too much.  Some of the chicken pieces were a bit dry.  For being General Tso's, it wasn't nearly spicy enough for me.

We couldn't decide on just one appetizer to order so we tried several each visit - Crispy Shrimp, Shumai, Scallion Pancakes, Crabmeat Rangoons and Steamed Dumplings. The rangoons could have used a little more crabmeat ...still delicious though and perfectly cooked. I would recommend each one of the appetizers and can't single one out as the best. For the main course I ordered the House Special Lo Mein and my husband had the Mongolian Beef after reading another review recommending it. We were not disappointed. My stepson had a Char-Grilled Teriyaki Beef. We all tasted each other's meals and decided the Mongolian Beef and Lo Mein were better than the Teriyaki Beef. My stepson commented though that he did like that the meat in the Char-Grill was tender and not grisly as you sometimes find in dishes with meat pieces. The food and appetizers were so good that we decided we should also order dessert. Last week we tried the fried ice cream/banana dessert. It was fantastic and more than enough for three of us. Tonight we ordered the Chinese donuts and decided to try the the Red Bean Pancakes after the owner described them to us. Again, we were not disappointed. We highly recommend this restaurant. My husband says this is the best Asian he's eaten, and I would agree.","2015-03-09 03:08:39"

We ordered the mapo tofu and the garlic eggplant, two staples of vegetarian dining in Americanized Chinese places.

The menu has expanded a bit over the years, now containing some sushi and Thai dishes.  Personally, I'd stick to the Chinese food.  One of my favorite dishes is the Walnut Shrimp, which also comes as a chicken option.  Candied walnuts along with battered and fried chicken or shrimp (not a health food I'm sure...) doused in a brown sweet, but a little spicy, sauce.  If you're not sure what to order or are not super adventurous, this is a great dish to start with.  I've yet to meet a person who doesn't like it.  The other entr¨¦e I order regularly is the Chicken with Garlic Sauce, which is a bit of a healthier option.  Saut¨¦ed chicken with numerous vegetables including broccoli, water chestnuts, onions, and baby corns in a garlic, somewhat spicy, sauce.  All of their entrees are HUGE, so come hungry, plan to split with someone, or leave with your lunch for the next day.  Their egg rolls are also amazing, and the duck sauce and spicy mustard they serve with them are delicious.  The spicy mustard will definitely clean out your sinuses if used in a moderate or large quantity!

The service is always friendly and helpful.  Most of their staff has been working here since I was a wee one, so they have to be doing something right!  The atmosphere is a classy Chinese restaurant with white table clothes, sometimes glowing candles or flowers, and fancy folding cloth napkins.  Not a bad place for a date or business dinner.  The only odd thing about the atmosphere, which has improved over the years, is the general location.  It shares a building with a car dealer's repair shop so from the outside it doesn't really scream fine dining, but keep on walking in and I guarantee you'll be pleasantly surprised.

My only beef with Sesame Inn is that years ago they discontinued my favorite appetizer, the Pu Pu platter.  I only put this fact in this review as a longshot attempt at getting it reinstated.

I drive past both of the Murray Ave China Stars every day (both located across the street from a Giant Eagle, presumably just to puzzle us more) and based on the addresses have confirmed the following--

THIS CHINA STAR:
-4219 Murray Ave, in Greenfield
-At the old location of Yen's Gourmet
-No affiliation with the China Star in the North Hills
-Standard American-Chinese food

THE OTHER CHINA STAR (http://www.yelp.com/biz/china-star-pittsburgh-3):
-1900 Murray Ave, in Squirrel Hill
-At the old location of Pacific Ring
-Affiliated with the China Star in the North Hills
-Traditional Chinese food

So, there you have it. A guide to the China Stars of Murray Avenue. I, personally, have only ordered from this China Star and cannot comment on the other.

For Chinese takeout--and I mean cheap, greasy, fried ""Chinese"" food--China Star is awesome. I mean, yeah, every Chinese takeout place with the infamous red menu is pretty much the same, and I feel stupid even writing a review of one on Yelp. But I get a craving for General Tso's Chicken, Pork Lo Mein, Cold Sesame Noodles, and Fried Dumplings about once a month, and now having tried several of Pittsburgh's Chinese options based on price and convenience, I gotta say China Star is my number one choice. Everything just tastes GOOD. I totally can't justify giving a Chinese restaurant more than 3 stars, but next time you feel the need to pig out on greasy takeout food, I'd highly recommend China Star.","2011-07-19 03:25:27"

I loved the large Asian style umbrellas hanging from the ceiling in different tiers. My boyfriend and I went to this place as he'd been before and enjoyed the food. I ordered the General Tso's chicken as I was starving and ready to maul a plate of food. I ordered first, and as Joe ordered his food, he asked for white meat chicken. ""Why ask for white meat chicken? This place charges $15 for an entree,"" I thought to myself. Well, indeed a place can charge whatever the hell they want per plate and still use chicken cuts I wouldn't put in my own dishes at home. I realized the meat in my order was dark, gummy, and stringy, however I figured I'd muddle through it and enjoy the crisp and sauce. I made it about a third of the way through my dish before encountering a gooey, gummy, ball of fat. I chewed until I thought I could stomach the bite, swallowed, and nearly gagged as part went down my throat and part was stuck on the back of my tongue.

I immediately felt sick to my stomach and the server, who I gathered may have been an owner, asked me if everything was alright. He was very sweet and attentive, so I didn't have the heart to tell him the General Tso's (standard order) had me on the verge of regurgitating my entire meal. I'm glad we had hot tea and that I had some wonton soup as an appetizer. Can I also mention there was shredded lettuce (not cabbage or the asian slaw) in my soup? Literally; shredded lettuce from a Subway sandwich should not be stewing in my bowl of soup.

I was happy my wonton soup was tepid at best, as it was easy to eat, but after I imagined what the chicken likely looked like before they battered and fried it, I thought to myself that the soup was likely under-temperature for what is passable by the ACHD.

I'd love to go back, but my stomach turns as I'm typing this review. Give it a shot, but if ordering something with chicken, by all means, request that it is White Meat. When they tell you ""oh that's the amazing chicken"" you'll know that the other type they serve is actually the pig slop.","2015-02-28 02:02:29"

I'm a big fan of Chinese food and fortunately one of my favorite places in the 'Burgh, Sesame Inn, has a place nearby.  They have an extensive list of ""Chef's Specials"" for lunch, so if you like good Chinese, you're bound to find something you'll like.  My tastes run to the basics, so I ordered the Lemon Chicken.  The crispy breading on the chicken wasn't overdone (I.e. I could still taste the chicken) and the meat itself was tender.  

The lunch specials include your choice of eggroll, hot-n-sour soup, or eggdrop soup.  Now I love my eggrolls and the hot-n-sour soup was mighty tempting.  But it'd been awhile since I'd tried the eggdrop soup and believe me, it really hit the spot.  You also get your choice of steamed, fried, or brown rice.

They just opened a few month ago.  This is their second restaurant, so you know they're pretty good.  Their first restaurant's on McKnight Road in McIntyre Square.  I recommend reading a few of the review for their other restaurant if you want get an idea of what they're about. 

The good China Star serves authentic Sichuan style Chinese food.  You can tell they're authentic and good cause when you walk in, many of their customers are Chinese.  For those of you who like the general tso's and lo meins, not to worry cause they have all the ""fake"" Chinese food too.  Some of my favorites are their tan tan noodles, scallion pancake, shrimp in chili sauce, double cooked pork, garlic egg plant and they have hot pot!  So, if you don't know which China Star to go to, pick this one.  It's just a few minutes away and the food is much MUCH better.  I would give this restaurant a 4.5 out of 5 stars just because the serves could have been better (not to say it was bad).

I've actually tried the other China Star too.  No authentic food there, but their ""fake"" Chinese food wasn't bad...it wasn't very good either.  It's kind of funny but I think the non-authentic Chinese food from the other China Star is better.  In short, if I feel like some good old general tso's, I'd rather go somewhere else.  I would give this restaurant a 2 out of 5 stars because the food is edible but nothing special at all.","2011-06-26 09:59:54"

To start, I ordered the Wonton Soup. It is delicious- plenty of big wontons. Next, I ordered a California roll to be shared with the table. Their California roll is amazing - my favorite place to grab some sushi. 

For my entree, I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken (with an up charge of $1 for brown rice) this meal is one of the favorites. I also often order the Amazing Chicken - it is also to die for.

He told me that it was their version of chow mein and it was my fault for not knowing that I should have asked if their version was real chow mein.

Lunches include an entree, rice, and soup or a soda, and most of them are under $5.  Most entrees are under $9 (except seafood entrees - the most expensive of which is $10.95).  The food is good and the restaurant is clean.  There is a big dining room with a cool circular doorway and the kind of typical Chinese knick-knacks you usually see, but it's fairly tastefully done. 

As far as food goes, their vegetable fried rice includes more veggies than usual, and the sesame tofu is deliciously crispy.

We had reservations at 7pm and we were seated promptly (even though we were a little late because of me). It was clearly a packed house and pretty much every table was occupied so we almost prepared ourselves for a service that may not be as great as last time.

Our server wasn't so bad though. He was juggling a ton of tables, but he checked up on us enough, I guess. The owners also checked on us, which was nice. We ordered the Peking Duck, which was a 3-course meal that consisted of all duck. 

The first course was duck skin with Mandarin crepes and a sauce on the side (Hoisin? I forget). The duck skin wasn't really crispy--it wasn't warm either. It was about room temperature and we struggled to bite through it without having to put the entire thing in our mouths to avoid making a mess. Yummy, but disappointing.

The second course was duck soup with vegetables. It's pretty straightforward. Good, but nothing too spectacular.

The third course was sauteed duck with vegetables and a side of rice. This was the most satisfying to us. The duck was tender and not gamy at all like some people might think. I was most happy with the abundance of bamboo sticks in the dish--loved it! We ended up taking it home since we were full from the rest of dinner.

What I loved about Sesame Inn is that there are few Asian cuisine restaurants that offer a nicer dining experience with a full bar, great ambiance, and attentive service. Though we did not drink, it was nice to have that option. 

I started with an order of the shrimp tempura roll as I wanted to try sushi from their open sushi bar. This was an excellent way to kick off the meal. So tasty! 

We each then ordered their sesame chicken, which I've had at almost every Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. This was some of the best! However, it definitely had a sweeter base than some others.

We have been going to Sesame Inn regularly since it opened 23 years ago. I have always raved about the quality food, service and atmosphere. 5 stars easy.
But after last night, NO MORE !
Went with my wife for dinner 8/22/18. The place was unusually empty. Yet it still took 20 minutes for a waitress to attend to our table. NO TEA? What had been part of the Sesame Inn experience for 20+ years, they would bring a complimentary pot of splendid chinese tea (oolong I think), to compliment the meal. Not any more. I was told now you have to order and buy it at 2.50 . What would people do with the remainder after dinner? Take it home in a chinese doggy bag? (It would leak). We reluctantly ordered a pot anyway and it was awful, considerably watered down with zero taste. Sent it back after a few sips. 
Ordered appetizers next, our usual dumplings, won ton soups and eggrolls. As usual these all were terrific, albeit very slow to get to our table after another 15 minutes. Ordered a main dish to split between us with a glass of wine for her and a gin martini for me. The martini was 70% water and 30% gin. A good dry martini doesn't contain water to my knowledge. It was awful. Didn't say anything.
The main dish came in another 15 minutes, but it was as we are accustomed to, terrific, 'triple delight' in brown sauce. 
We have NEVER had a negative experience at Sesame Inn until last night. (OK, there was one time a couple years ago some shrimp appeared to not have been cleaned well at all, with the waste black line in the spines still there. Chose to simply set the shrimp aside and not eat the few dirty ones since we figured this was a very atypical issue and didn't mention it). 
But if they want to now charge for tea, water down drinks, insist on extremely slow service, well, we would just as soon find another chinese restaurant. We left very disappointed although the food was typically very good. These are the kind of changes in the details that will diminish the overall quality of a dining experience that, for high prices for the food, are not worth the visit. 
In the past we felt that the quality of taste, value, complimentary tea, pure drinks (not watered down), and spot on timely service was worth the cost of the dishes, which would warrant at least 5 stars. I am no longer wondering why the place was not very busy, and not packed as during the vast majority of previous visits. They have lowered their standards in service, become cheap and thrifty with the tea and drinks, and will therefore ultimately lose customers and business, beginning with us and our family.","2018-08-23 19:33:35"

However, other dishes I ordered are disappointing. I would only give 3 star for the food. However, the service is great and the restaurant looks pretty clean. Overall I'd say 3.5 star for this place. Round up to 4 star because of the service. 
I would go back to try other dishes though.

Review for specific dish
Green Bean: tastes fishy. It's quite strange when your vegetables taste fishy and there was too much garlic.
Eggplant in garlic sauce: I think they used pre made sauce for eggplant. The sauce tastes too similar to Lee Kum Kee eggplant sauce (which is definitely not authentic). In addition, the eggplant is so bland. 
Steamed whole fish: average 
Beef soup: tastes great. It's a real hassle to avoid all the carrots and green beans though.. It would be perfect if cilantro is used instead of carrots and beans.","2014-06-12 23:55:59"

The chicken was Average, my wonton soup had an odd flavor and was disappointing but I ate the won tons out of it because it was the best part out of all the food I ordered. My egg roll had a mysterious neon pink color meat that was finely ground up like taco bell meat and didn't really resemble a meat I am familiar with. Still not sure what it was.

The dan dan noodles had a good flavor but the sauce was too liquid-y, and the noodles over cooked. There was no ma-la to them, and they didn't give much quantity for the price. 

The fatty pork was the best dish. It was actually fantastic and they should tout it instead of the lamb skewers. 

The lamb kabobs coulda been, shoulda been, and woulda been great if they hadn't had such a heavy hand with the seasoning. The meat was moist and tender, the marinated meat was flavorful. If you order it, I strongly recommend you tell them to leave off the dusting of seasoning. That made it sooooo salty. I couldn't bear to eat more than one bite. 

The potato dish was the true definition of ""meh""....a little crunchy, and yet somehow also a little soggy. And not appetizing looking in the least.

The last dish was another noodle one, I didn't try it, but I took a picture. 

So, I would have given them a 3 except I was using my water cup to rinse off the spiciness from everything for my 6 yr old- (btw nothing says it's spicy but it pretty much all was) and they came by several times and despite seeing my oily red water, they never inquired whether I might like another glass of fresh water.

Lamb skewer: if you are born and grew up in China, make sure to get the lamb skewer, one of the most famous Chinese street food! Their lamb skewer is even better than most of what you can get in China!

Beef skewer: it looks like this is more for those who like skewer but doesn't like lamb. It's also good but just not what I was growing up with.

The decor and music in the restaurant is not typical of an Asian restaurant.  No scrolls with calligraphy and traditional Asian music - instead they play older American music and have old movie posters on the wall.  Good choice of Bose speakers.

My main criticism is in regard to the restaurant's kabobs.  Seeing ""Kabob"" in the restaurant's name, I had high expectations for this dish.  First, the kabobs took a long time to prepare.  My party ordered 2 dishes and the kabobs, which we assumed would be the appetizer.  Actually, the kabobs came out after we were finished with the first 2 dishes.  The beef kabobs we ordered were small - 6 for about $12.  Also, they weren't particularly tender or well seasoned.

The other 2 dishes were tasty.  A little on the salty side, but adequately spicy.  We ordered the spicy string beans and a dish with chicken and mixed vegetables.  The spicy string beans were my favorite - filled with spicy peppers, garlic, and ginger.  My party's chicken dish was tasty - nothing extraordinary, but good.  I could agree with a previous reviewer that the sauce tasted similar to what you find in the Asian supermarket, but I wasn't displeased with this dish.

If this restaurant works on its kabobs, I would give it 4 stars.  Also, I would advocate for more entrees from the grill.  But 3 stars for now.","2014-06-13 13:43:17"

The other night, Kay didn't feel like cooking again, and luckily, GG delivered to Beechview. 

I'll credit them for a speedy delivery. The food came in less time than the operator stated. 

The story of the meal lies in the octet of gigantic and graciously filling fried dumplings. How the cooks wrap these pot stickers around so much ground pork remains a mystery, but their delightfully doughy composition and deep gusto is unquestionable. If I'd only had the dumplings, GG would easily garner a grade of 4 from me. 

I did not sample Kay's Shrimp and Scallop with Garlic Sauce, but the Happy Family was as dysfunctional as the Bluth clan...

The advertised lobster was non-existent,  the crab was merely flavorless,dyed whitefish, the chicken was dry, and the roast pork was scant as were the scallops. The veggies were in abundance, however, and the fat prawns popped in my mouth. So yeah, this gathering was a little awkward. 

The Beef-On-A Stick could have been a joy...if it was properly tender. I hadn't gnawed on meat this tough in years! I almost spit it out since my jaws were sore from chewing it and had half a mind to de-skewer the other slab and feed it to the dogs! It's a shame since the meat itself was marinated beautifully and pungently in what I assume was soy sauce, but the marinade failed to break down the meat.

Another dish I like is crispy and spicy zhu da chang (pork), which is another authentic Chinese dish. 

What differentiates Han from a lot of other Chinese restaurants is the fact that the dishes there are not that greasy. 
 
Typically, I do not eat lamb, because I cannot stand the smell of lamb. However, the lamb skewers they served there really impressed me. My friends ordered some and persuaded me to try. I was brave and took a risk. Well, it was definitely worth a try because the meat was so tender without any weird smell of lamb at all. Highly recommend the lamb skewers.  I got the spicy one and added extra hot pepper powder on it (love their hot pepper powder).

I enjoyed the fried noodles that came with the Mandarin beef although the Mongolian beef was a little too chewy. It was not bad by any means, but I have tried better Mongolian beef dishes. 

I think the service is a five stars although I only had a limited experience with it on my pick-up order. The staff took my phone order accurately and quickly, understanding all of the items I requested, which was a pleasant surprise. I was given an ETA of my food being ready for pickup within 10 minutes after ordering. I found my order already done when I went to pick it up about 15 minutes after my call. The cashier was also friendly and remembered what I ordered right away. There were a couple other orders ready when I went. 

Two small complaints I have are the soy sauce and fortune cookies. I ended up using my own soy sauce because of some sketchy ingredients in the soy sauce packets. (see my picture below) Also, the fortune cookies were a bit stale, you can bend it back and forth because of the moisture. Anyways, this didn't bother me too much because I don't usually eat fortune cookies anyways and I had my own soy sauce at home.

The stewed pork was excellent and probably one of their most popular dishes, besides the lamb skewers. Lamb skewers can be made not spicy at all to painfully hot, depending on your preference. And the fried rice is surprisingly good. The only thing I might recommend staying away from is the eggplant dish, which was slightly undercooked the last time I tried it.","2015-09-13 14:45:29"

I had to stop in here after being floored by how delicious the food looked in an Instagram post (https://instagram.com/p/BL_v5RYhfyJ/) and wouldn't rest until I had it in front of me. The food absolutely delivered on how incredible it looked!

We had the boiled crispy fish fillet (get this!!!), spicy Korean noodle soup (just as good as any local ramen place), Chinese bok choy with shiitakes, and lamb skewers. I highly recommend all of it, and can't wait to try everything on the menu. I also love that they locally source their lamb.

I was born in China and lived there for the first several years of my life, so I can attest to the authenticity of this place :) Their most popular dish is the lamb kabobs. I highly, highly, highly recommend getting this!! Lamb kabobs are probably one of the most renowned street foods in China, so I'm really glad Han Chinese is bringing them to Cleveland :) It's $13 for 6 kabobs, which can seem a bit pricey, but it's worth the splurge! The seasoning, which is composed mainly of peppers and cumin, is so authentic that it makes me feel like I'm eating in China's night market. I also tried the Dandan noodles, one of my favorite dishes of all time. Han Chinese did a great job with this as well! It was spicy (but not overwhelming) and savory :) Make sure you check in to receive a free lamb kabob with your purchase of a lamb kabob order!! 

Pros: 
- Authentic Chinese food (finally!)
- Clean restaurant 
- Price is decent 
- Waiters speak Mandarin

Sure, there were plenty of places on Green that served Chinese but since I'm a bit spoiled by the quality of Chinese food on the West Coast, it never really satisfied me. So, the next best option was to get delivery. Nothing beats settling in with a good bowl of hot and sour soup right before finals. I really like their pepper salted shrimp, buns, braised string beans/kong xin cai, soup, and stir fried noodles. Go for their authentic dishes, some of the more Americanized ones can be sort of lacklustre (for example, General Tso's Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken...) If you want to go to the physical restaurant it might be kind of hard to find since it's a little bit of a hole in the wall but it's definitely worth it. 

Pros:
-Fast delivery
-Secure delivery. I haven't had a single dish spill en-route before, unlike a lot of places!
-Super nice service
-Reasonably priced (a LOT of places on campus are really expensive considering what they're feeding you but this place is awesome.)
-Good food
-Good portions
-Good variety
-Good for groups
-Interior of the store is cozy, clean, and well done

Cons:
-Food can be oily, but to be honest those particular dishes are oily anywhere
-The Americanized dishes aren't that good in my opinion
-It might be a bit hard to communicate with the restaurant if you don't speak any Chinese but the online ordering is done via services like Eat24 and in person you can just point to what you want. Not that big of an issue.
-Sometimes food might be too salty, but if you tell them that you want less salt, they'll follow your request.
-Delivery only on $20+ so I recommend just buying with other people or buying a portion for dinner. They give you plenty of rice so you'll have more than enough for a couple meals.","2015-11-25 21:23:22"

So of course, I had to order some of the other food off the menu to keep me fed.  And boy am I glad that I did!  Because I didn't even know that I liked it so much, until I realized that I just keep coming back!

Some of my favorites include the spicy string beans, and salt & pepper shrimp.  I've also had whole fish here, and I've had a couple of the ground pork dishes (I love wood ears and they aren't super common ingredients, so I love that I can always get it here).

They're open late, it's casual and easy.  There's never a wait, but there's always a few other tables eating.  It's a no fuss great Chinese restaurant that's authentic, affordable, and open all the time.  What more can you ask for.

Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going.","2015-08-02 04:12:41"

This place is EXTREMELY hit or miss, more so then I ever seen a restaurant be... The first time I went here with coworkers, the food was hot, came quick, and tasted terrific. At the time, I would have ALMOST gave it a 5 star rating. I was glad I didn't though. I went back a second time and the food came out cold, there was a long wait, and it didn't taste nearly as good. I went back a third time, and this time the food was just average tasting.  My entree was great but the soup and egg roll tasted weird.. The service was also bad this trip. 

The 4th time I went back though was what ultimately makes the place deserve the 2 star rating, as not only was the service terrible, but our food took almost 45 minutes to come out and there were only three tables filled in the restaurant.
 
The worst part was that me and my girlfriend got food sickness from it... It was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day.  We are pretty sure it was from the egg drop soup.  It had large chunks of either oil or raw egg in it, and we were sick for nearly two weeks with stomach cramps.  

Somewhat trivial but the day was only made worse as the waitress made pricing errors on my bill, of which I had to argue with her that egg rolls came with the lunch special and were not supposed to be an extra charge... 

At this point, other then the first time I went there, the food has been pretty sub-par, and food comes out cold way too often... Service can also go from great to absolutely terrible depending on who is working that day. I wanted to really like this place since it is close to my work, and the food is priced right ($6-7 for a big plate), but unfortunately, bad service, long wait times, and food that frequently goes from tasting good to absolutely terribly has me moving on. Eater's beware, maybe you'll get a good meal, but you may get a terrible one too....","2011-05-09 17:52:51"

The environment of this place is pretty nice. We tried to order grilled squid, but they are out, so we ordered grilled beef instead. However, we are not quite sure they gave us the grilled beef or lamb, cuz the meat has some unpleasant taste, but the waitress insisted it's beef.  We found not only the meat, but the seasoning is not quite pleasant either... Two of us only placed 1 order which comes with 6 skews, and we couldn't finish the entire order cuz of the unpleasant flavor. This place is supposed to serve good grill & kabob, however we are pretty disappointed at their kabob. 
We also ordered couple appetizers, the Szechuan cold noodle and sliced pork with garlic sauce. These 2 appetizers are pretty tasty, the cold noodle is leaning toward oily side.

My bf opted for the boiled beef, a house specialty. He has a much higher tolerance for spice than I, so he loved it. It came in a hot pot with various spices and veggies. I tried one bite and my tongue became overwhelmed by heat. It was good but hellsa hot. Also served with a side of rice.

I can't wait to return. The service was wonderful. They were very attentive, courteous and friendly. Now, time to shamelessly eat my leftovers for breakfast at 9:26 a.m.","2016-11-19 14:26:31"

I've had much better ""fast food"" style Chinese food in more rural areas, so I felt disappointed by the lackluster performance of the meal.

The Good: The fried dumplings were amazing and while the wonton soup was strangely missing its green onions, it was still tasty. Actually, I'm thinking of always having my dumplings fried from now on like potstickers, because it really made my night.

The Bad: I ordered the classic General Tso's to get a good range of what they offered and Moo Goo Gai Pan, which is chicken and veggies in a white sauce (one of my favorite Chinese dishes). The food was...just ok. The General Tso's sauce was a bit too red in color but it was crispy like it should be and it tasted fine. The white sauce dish was sort of...off. I can't even explain it, but a couple of bites in I started hating the taste. The veggies were cooked well, but the chicken wasn't of a very high quality and my taste buds got turned off by the whole dish. These are classic dishes and if you can't get them right that worries me. My meal started going downhill around there.

The Ugly: I ordered both fried and steamed rice (again to get a good sampling), and the fried rice was bad. It was too brown, not really fried (just limp), and very sparse with a few carrots and peas and no scrambled egg bits (not de rigueur for delivery Chinese but I do love when fried rice has that in it). I'm not sure what happened - did they use new rice, or wet rice, or cooked it too long? Whatever it was, it was horrible. I might try to refry it tomorrow, but if it is still bad I'll probably just have to pitch it. 

The price for all of this was about the same for what I've paid for Chinese meals at restaurants and delivery places that I consider to be a little more ""upscale."" So I didn't think I was saving any money, and I was getting less quality for my troubles. There are several Asian places in the area that make great food, so I don't feel like I need to limit myself to this one.","2016-01-14 07:00:27"

First off, I like their on-line ordering system very much; easy to use and you get a confirmation emailed back.  The place is one of the ubiquitous hole-in-the-wall spots with just a couple of tables so you have a place to wait for your order if you're early.  My order, dinner for two with some fried pot stickers on the side was ready on time shortly after I got there.

The menu is pretty varied and includes a lot of choices that aren't on the typical cheap Chinese list.  Dinner for two at $18.98 is a good value since you get won ton soup, egg rolls and fried rice for two along with any two entrees priced under $9.75 each, which covers a lot more items than the typical dinner for two choice list.  Most of the menu choices meet the price limit with the exception of those in the seafood and specialty section, so you really get a good number to choose from.  

The food:  I ordered Hunan Beef for me and Lemon Chicken for my wife.  The beef was lean and tender, and was very plentiful and came with nice crispy vegetables (baby corn, water chestnuts, broccoli, green pepper, onions, mushrooms and a bit of carrot.  The sauce was not sweet (I hate sweet Hunan sauce).  I prefer mine a little greasier (House of Hunan in Fairlawn's sauce is the gold standard); however New King's is acceptable.  My wife's lemon chicken was OK for her; she makes what I think is terrific lemon chicken so I've never been inclined to order it; however she wanted to compare hers.  Totally different, so there's really no way to say how it compares with other restaurants' and frankly most don't even have it.  She liked the crispness of the broccoli that comes with it.  The won ton soup was alright, the broth was good with scallions and nice thin-skinned stuffed won tons, but no pork or bok choy.  The egg rolls were nothing special, although they were nicely fried and not greasy.  The pot stickers were really good.  The fried rice was decent as well, much better than the stuff you get sometimes that's just brown colored with no vegetables.  It would have been much better if they had thrown a few chunks of pork in.

All in all it was a good value and a good experience.  You get tons of food, including 2 separate pints of soup and fried rice, so apart from the egg rolls, everything is packaged per person.  I plan to try their lunch specials very soon because again, they have a big selection of items AND hot & sour soup is one choice (I love me some good hot & sour soup).  New China King is a keeper for me!

We also tried the grilled squid, can either get the body or the tentacles, each for 4 dollars. .I personally prefer the tentacles as they are a little crunchy.
My wife loved the chefs special noodles with wasabi sause. My favorite is the whole fish in bean sause with rice. About 18$ but worth the price. . It's a whole fish prepared with the right proportion of sweet and spicy that will surely titillate your taste buds.

I wanted her to try something different on this visit.  So I took her to the buffet and asked her what she wanted.  Unfortunately, she didn't want any delicious fried rice or green beans.  She asked for crab legs, without haste.  

I searched the buffet for crab legs, but they were out or not serving them tonight.  So I gave her a helping of crabmeat and an egg roll.  She seemed content.  Then she had some jello and then she asked for ice cream.

One of the great things about my favorite Chinese buffet is, well, the selection.  They have American food and Chinese food.  I must have written 100 reviews on Double Dragon, but the food is soooo good to me.  Love it.  

Being Friday, I knew restaurants would be busy, and Dragon Gate was packed to the gills, so we returned to our usual, Double Dragon Buffet.  To my surprise, this very large restaurant was about 90% full.  It's one of the first times I've seen it that packed, but it made me happy because it shows that the business is thriving.  

The one thing that always bothers me a little about buffets are the people that eat at them.  Some people just do not know when to stop eating and it shows in their physique.  I hope one day Americans will wake up and realize that gorging yourself constantly will eventually take its fateful toll.","2011-02-05 02:34:42"

Our food arrived a short time later.  I LOVED the noodles and the spring rolls.  The chicken kabobs were just ok, nothing to write home about,  but can't say that I enjoyed the lamb.

Quite honestly I expected actual grills on the tables or something - but the grill repertoire (3 types of kabobs, maybe 4 other grill items) was a tiny subset of a fairly extensive typical Chinese menu.

We had the beef kabobs which did not taste very Chinese to me (though apparently they are a very specific regional Northern Chinese street food).  They were seasoned with an overwhelmingly strong mix of spices that tasted Mediterranean or Middle Eastern to me (cumin? fennel?).  The meat was not marinated though - or if it was, it needed a lot more marinade.  Can't comment on the authenticity, but overall, I felt that the kabobs were overseasoned and underseasoned at the same time, and I did not enjoy them.  And at $7 for 3 kabobs they seemed pricey to me.

Now that being said, the rest of the Chinese food here is pretty authentic and good!  The beef noodle soup had an extremely well flavored broth and the correct type of noodles, though the meat was a bit on the chewy side.  The seafood hot pot was very tasty too and had a good amount of shrimp, squid and tofu.  The stir fried bean curd with pork was pretty authentic too.  The restaurant itself was also full of Chinese clientele.

As it turns out, the delivery menu is the Americanized menu, which probably isn't what you're looking for, unless your favorite Chinese food consists of some chicken dish possibly invented by some sort of military guy.

At the restaurant, make sure you get the Chinese menu (blue cover). The menu has English, Chinese, as well as Korean text.

My family ordered the shredded pork with hot garlic sauce, stir fry beef with ziran, and the all inclusive hot pot. The all inclusive hot pot had fried tofu, bamboo, rice noodles, snap peas, Chinese sausage, mushrooms, and steamed meatballs. Bowls of rice are free and all you can eat! These are large portions, meant to be shared with at least one other person, unless you are very hungry!

My favorite dish was the hot pot. The mushrooms were meaty and the soup was sublime.  The pork and beef were both very tasty, great over some rice. No food was left behind. :)

The owners are quite kind, although their children can be found running around the restaurant playing. This was a bit noisy, but I'm quite used to noise. Some customers are noisier, however.

The servers aren't half bad, and are very attentive for the most part. With the exception of one terrible service I went to, I can't bad mouth them much.

Just stand there looking at the food, and thinking that something is going to change just by staring at it. Then you got the roadblocks. These are the fat ass people who come to a buffet because it would be much cheaper to spend seven dollars here to feast, than it would be at home. These people move extremely slow, breathe heavy, and take huge portion. Also you have to go completely around them in order to advance and get on with your life. Then there is loud cellphone idiot. The name is self explanatory so if you need a description of this type of person, you may just be that very type of person: An idiot. Then you just have stupid people in general.

The all inclusive hot pot was one of the best things I had there and can easily be a full meal for a single person as it includes clear rice noodles for some filling carbs.  The shredded Szechuan spicy pork was a close second though it should be noted for people who don't know how Chinese pork is shredded, it is cut into thin slices and THEN cooked versus the famous bbq shredded pork in America which is slow cooked and then shredded by hand.  This leads to a more solid texture in the meat and it great when paired with thinly cut vegetables as they do with this dish. The ziran beef had strong flavors and wasn't drenched in a sauce like Americanized places.  For those who are afraid to try it, ziran means cumin so if you like cumin you will love this flavor of beef.

When I was in college, I studied abroad in China and ended up living there for five years. I'm originally from Cleveland, and nothing prepared me for authentic Chinese food. I ate myself stupid at small, cheap, restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai, and when I came back, it was hard to find anything comparable. Americanized Chinese food lacks the spice and tang of the real deal, opting instead of sugary, corn-starch heavy sauces. While other Chinese restaurants in the vicinity of Han do a fair job of approximating authentic dishes, Han is the best at capturing the authentic flavor while not drowning its dishes in oil.

The strength of Han is based on its outstanding head chef, who makes ordinary Chinese restaurant staples with flair and excellence. Although Han advertises itself as a kebab place (and the kebabs are really good, and if you've ever eaten chuanr off a grill at midnight in a back alley in Beijing, you'll agree with me), it's best experienced as a northern Chinese restaurant that also serves kebabs. And yes, the kebabs are heavily spiced. If you just want grilled meat, please tell them so, because in China, they pour the spice on with great enthusiasm.

I personally recommend the Dandan Noodles (dandan mian), the spicy string beans (ganbian sijidou) and the Sliced Pork in Garlic Sauce (yuxiang rousi). But everything is good - I haven't had a bad dish here.

I will say that that they are sometimes served more spicy than others, so you might order them mild, if that's more suitable for your palette. If you've never had Chinese kebabs before, know that cumin and chili are the main seasonings. The menu has many other traditional soups, apps and entrees, as well. I've never left here hungry or disappointed with my meal!","2018-08-12 22:52:06"

"m-EmDuGmYa6iXu5Wk8_CUw","FGh5WAvwIqKSoRQwn91qLw","uuQDpnCYn1Nf2pXZTtMLHg",4,6,0,4,"I've been on a search for some good Chinese carryout/delivery.  You know there are some nights when ordering some good Americanized Chinese food that we all love, then curl up with a movie and snuggle in for the night.  I noticed favorable Yelp reviews for this new place and thought it was worth giving it a whirl. 

We ordered online (very smooth process) and 45 min later a sweet man delivered food for me and my friends.  I'm not sure what the usual delivery time is and it doesn't tell you when you order online or in the confirmation.  I guess like pizza you should assume an hour and maybe it will be earlier.  

Every Chinese place I've tried in the surrounding area I've picked-up carryout 1X not finding it worthy of a rerun.  Let's be real -- I've had some terrible Chinese!  But this was overall a great experience, fresh food -- I'll be a regular.

My gold standard for judging a Chinese restaurant is Broccoli in Garlic Sauce/Tofu and Hot & Sour Soup.  Both of these items are designated as ""Hot and Spicy"" -- but in this place neither lived up to the promise.  The broccoli was very fresh and the fried tofu was fine (a little soggy/spongy) but the sauce was as thin as water rather than a sauce. I ordered it designating medium heat unsure what hot would be in a new place (better safe than sorry) and my receipt showed medium as ""little spice"".  If you like spicy just know medium had zero pepper heat and no sign of those lovely little red peppers that normally I would remove before eating.  I would order this dish again and hope for a richer sauce with some heat but I was very happy with the generous, fresh, not overcooked broccoli.  The rice was fresh and perfectly cooked. Yes, belief me when I say not all places have good rice.

The hot and sour soup as another reviewer said full of fresh, chunky veggies but I loved that and the flavor was good but needed to be kicked up.  Still way better than I've had anywhere else around here. I ordered the soup spice level of hot -- sadly again literally no heat to this at all.  So, I'm thinking if you want any heat you'll need to ask for extra, extra, extra hot assuming the same cook is in the kitchen.  Not sure what the issue is with getting 'hot and spicy' right.  I'd love a little container of peppers in oil if they are afraid customers are going to say things are too hot or just start making hot and spicy dishes, hot and spicy.  :)

The other dish we had was a rice noodle dish Vegetable Mei Fun which had just a few veggies but great flavor and we'd get this one again.  The rice noodles were not overcooked but perfect. 

We wanted to get crab rangoon as an appetizer but it wasn't menu.  After placing the order my friend said, ""oh, look ...fried crab meat cheese wonton"" that must be the crab rangoon.  We had read it as crab & some kind of meat & cheese -- sooo we missed out.  Next order, right?

So, if you have a hankering for some tasty Chinese, hop online and place an order www.newchinakinglakewood.com","2015-09-06 23:29:55"

If you walk into Peking Garden and they hand you that menu with the classic Americanized dishes (General Tso's chicken, lo mien, fried rice, etc.), tell them that you actually want to see the menu with the traditional, true-blue Chinese dishes (squid, sea cucumber, etc.).  Unfortunately, I can't vouch for the Americanized food items as I've never tasted them.  

However, there IS just one thing that makes this restaurant GOLDEN in my book: Peking Garden is the ONLY Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area (to my knowledge) where you can eat a very specific type of traditional Chinese cuisine called hot pot (sometimes called shabu-shabu in Japanese restaurants).  If you've never eaten hot pot before, let me explain the general idea: a portable stove and miniature pot of boiling broth will be brought to your table.  You will also be given plates of raw vegetables, meat, and noodles.  You toss whatever you want to eat into the pot, wait a few minutes, and then start serving the soup from your table.  Definitely a treat during winter months, and worth a try for adventurous diners!    

I haven't tried too many other dishes here, but I did order dumplings once, and have been requesting them on visits ever since.  Usually most Asian restaurants (even the Chinese ones) sell what I consider Japanese or Korean dumplings.  The outside dough is paper-thin, indicating that the dumplings were probably bought frozen instead of prepared in-store.  At Peking Garden, the dumpling dough is thick and chewy, the way Chinese dumplings are SUPPOSED to be!  The meat filling is still a little plain (just ground pork and a few carrots, nothing special), but the dough wrappers are FO' REAL!

The interior decor is that faded '80s look that seems to plague a lot of the restaurants in this area.  You can't really tell if the evening mood lighting is actually mood lighting or if they just didn't bother to fix some broken bulbs.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic rendezvous, but it could be fun for friends eating in large groups.

Everybody loves Lai Lai or Golden Harbor, and while the menus at those restaurants are a good deal larger, Peking Garden does have its own unique specialty, the hot pot.  If you're not sure what to do when you get there, stare at the tables of Chinese diners, follow their lead, and you won't be disappointed!","2011-08-24 12:44:40"

The Chicken lo mein was good. Flavorful noodles and a nice mix of what appeared to be good quality chicken and fresh veggies. Portion size including the rice was huge. Definitely enough for two big meals. The egg rolls that game with it were average.

My Empress chicken was alright. It was lightly breaded chicken chunks with a mix of fresh broccoli, bamboo shoots, mushrooms and bok choy. It was good but the sauce that it was in didn't really impress me. It tasted like every other sweet and sour sauce. The chicken also seemed to be a little soft and mushy. I'm not sure why this would be, but I feel like it should have had at least a little firm texture?

Our meal cost $21. Between two people, we were able to make two meals each out of our food, so I suppose the portion size/price is justified. I unfortunately was just not very impressed with my Empress chicken.

I didn't grow up eating these types of flavors, and only when I went to western china for a summer as an adult did I really get exposed for the first time. When I got back stateside, I really craved these flavors! I really enjoy how diverse the flavors in Chinese cooking can be. 

We arrived on a Sunday evening for a meal - plenty of seating available, but also a steady stream of people coming in to eat. Our small party ended up ordering a bunch of different types of food to try - it was definitely double what we could handle but we were happy to take leftovers home. Here we go:

Appetizers:

4 - Potato salad - cold, thinly sliced/julienned, lightly cooked/raw potato with chili flakes + peppercorn. You can get this as a main dish, larger, hot/stir fried. This is one of the small appetizer dishes that I missed the most from China! Very clean flavor as there isn't much oil. The flavor went well with...

3.5 - ...Chef's Noodle Special - cold, flat, rice noodles with a slightly spicy sauce (horseradish flavor) with julienned veggies + egg. It's a great raw dish. I really like the dish in general, but found this one to be a little watery w/ not enough of the sauce. We think it's b/c the veggies weren't drained enough of the water. It's also usually banquet size, but I think it's a good portion for this size of a restaurant. Probably shareable between 4 people. Hopefully they will adjust as this is such a crave-worthy dish.

4 - Tomato and egg soup - clean and delicious flavor, great on a cold fall day. Pretty standard flavor, but good nonetheless.  

MAINS:

5 - Lamb kabobs - I have been craving these like crazy. Totally reminds me of the mutton kabobs we used to eat that summer. We ordered it spicy and it did not disappoint. After we placed the order, we could smell a wood burning stove in the back. Our guess is that they have one in the back for the kabobs. I checked in on yelp and got a free kabob skewer :) Ours was really tender. The dish comes with 6 skewers, but if you get enough dishes, it should totally be enough. 

5 - Stir fried cabbage - this one has one of my favorite spices...prickly ash!! I love how these dishes are able to have tons of flavor while not using that much oil. The dish was crunchy. We noticed that both the cabbage and red chills had a char (again probably from the bbq) on the edges - so good.

4.5 - Tomato beef noodle soup - I have been looking for this holy grail. The sweetness of the tomato broth was a welcome break from the other flavors. Just keep in mind that it's not Taiwanese style - so the beef comes sliced rather than in shank form. I thought the broth was a winner though.

5 - Xinjiang LAMB - ok, definitely spicy and matches the flavor of the stir fried cabbage. By the time we got it we were really full. Definitely shareable between 4+ people. Lots of prickly ashhhhh and cumin seeds. As you may know, Xinjiang province is in western China and has a high Muslim population. (no pork!) so lamb/mutton is a huge part of the halal cuisine there. Such a different experience than on the coast. 

3.5 - Pickled pork belly - we thought we were ordering something similar to the twice cooked pork belly (should've listened to the waitress!) but we decided to try this one. The main flavor on this one is definitely sour - they use lots of sour veggies with crystal noodles and bits of pork. It reminded me of sauerkraut. My palette is not used to the intensity of sourness so we barely made our way through and it felt off for us (maybe a hint of sweetness would have helped). Also, it's a huge portion and the ratio of cabbage to meat to noodles was off. 

OVERALL:
We found this place to have really diverse flavors. We also liked that it relied more on spice + flame rather than oil, unlike some other nearby restaurants.  Since I didn't grow up with the flavors, it was definitely an adjustment. But a welcome adjustment.

Service wise - similar to other Chinese restaurants. Don't be afraid to make eye contact and slightly raise your hand in the air - it's culturally acceptable. We had to do that a few times for tea and water. Otherwise, it's clean and cafe style.

I said to myself ""Chinese kabobs?... must try it!"" Was hungry and decided to get some take out just to try it. Known for their lamb skewers, I got a few... half spicy, half mild. And I also decided to try their pork belly with garlic appetizer. Smelled so good in the car, I couldn't wait to get home and chow. Wow, wow, wow! Where do I start? The lamb... amazing! I like lamb, but it has to be done just right. Most lamb not prepared well has that musty/gamey after taste. This did not! It was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, perfectly flavored! Both mild and spicy were delicious! And there was this distinct flavor that really brought it home... couldn't tell exactly what it was... maybe just from grilling... maybe smoke? I don't know, but it was damn good!

And the garlic pork belly? Wow! It was awesome as well! I couldn't believe this was just an appetizer. They need to offer it as an entree. That spicy sauce and seasonings over rice? Hmmm! Couldn't decide if I liked the lamb or pork belly better. I guess I'll have to go back and re-order so I can decide. And if I can't decide yet... I'll be okay with trying for the rest of my life. It's that good! Safe to say I think I'll be back!!","2015-03-31 18:12:49"

The woman who normally takes my order over the phone is usually the same person who delivers the food to me.  She is a sweetheart, and when I ordered from a different phone number than I normally do, she recognized my address right away when I gave it to her and asked how I was doing.  What a great memory and way to connect with your customers!

Now, for the food.  I've only ordered a couple dishes from here, but I feel no need to change my order any time soon-Mongolian beef and the General Tso's is the usual.  First of all, I love that they ask no questions about making things spicy/extra spicy.  The mongolian beef is ordinarily not spicy, but when I asked if they could add some spice, they enthusiastically said yes- I haven't ordered it unspicy since.  The beef is sooo tender and the sauce they cook it in is to die for.  I literally would eat it everyday if I had a heart of steel.  The General Tso's is pretty good, although not outstanding.  It's a little too sweet and saucy for my taste, but I like to have something to contrast the beef, so this is usually what I go for.

The only other dish I've ordered is the Fried Diced Chicken w Red Pepper.  It's pretty much a party in your mouth.  Super spicy, just how I like it- the chicken is cut up small, covered in batter, and deep fried, almost like popcorn chicken, and salty, which is awesome with a plain white rice.  The only reason I don't order this all the time is because it's a little too spicy and I don't want to regret eating it the next day.

So, I can't speak for a ton of dishes, but the ones I've had thus far have been very palatable.  And the delivery service is great.  Woohoo!","2012-02-25 01:31:54"

That's this place for me. After passing by it for years, I finally actually stepped inside to grab a to-go order. 

The place has ""kabob"" in the name so I figured that's what I'd go with. I ordered a fish ball kabob and squid. When asked how spicy I wanted it, I learned that not spicy isn't so much an option so I went with medium. I'm not going to lie, it burned a bit too much for my liking but that's on me - sometimes Chinese spice is no joke. I have to say that I liked the squid more than the fish balls so if you're debating between the two (very specific debate right there I know), I'd go with the squid. Also if it turns out too spicy for you, you can always wipe some of it off. Sounds sacrilegious I know but it's coated with it after it's done being grilled/fried/however they prepare it so it's not embedded into the squid itself. Apart from the spice, the squid had a good texture and was good while the fishballs lacked in taste though the texture was fine. Both were also very cheap, like under $7 or so together.

The menu of this place is MASSIVE so I'm curious to come back and try more off of it. It's also surprisingly roomy inside with more tables and booths than I expected.

Since I've reviewed another Chinese restaurant and hope to continue doing so, I decided it would be best to get the same dish (General's Chicken).  I know this is not traditional Chinese but it is a common dish and is one of my favorites.

The first difficulty I had with Peking Garden is ordering.  They do not have a website and it is not easily found online.  Luckily I was able to find one on campusfood.com.  Next, I noticed that the entrees were sort of expensive (my dish was $10.90 with tax).  This isn't too outrageous as the portions were relatively large but there are plenty of other, cheaper options in the area.

After finding the menu and placing the order over the phone, I was told it would only be about 10 minutes until our food was ready.  When we arrived around 10 minutes later, our food was waiting for us at the front counter.  One thing that I did not care for right away was that the rice for both of our orders was included in one container.  This isn't a huge deal but would have been easier for us had they been separate.   

My meal had pretty good flavor, though it wasn't as spicy as other places.  Despite the flavor, both my roommate and I noticed that the chicken was tough to the point it was chewy.  This is probably the biggest reason for my 3-star rating as almost all other Chinese I have had has been very tender.

Overall the meal was good but I doubt that I will be returning to Peking Garden anytime soon.","2010-06-27 00:49:08"

I found myself @ Peking Garden celebrating a friends' completion of his prelims.  Nate decided that he was going to have a Mai Tai, and it came in a disturbing Fu-Manchu mug complete with exaggerated Asian features.  I was horrified and delighted simultaneously.

Just an average chinese buffet.  The hot and sour soup was good.  The eggrolls, not so much.  The selection of entrees was good and everything was reasonably well presented but nothing really stirred my imagination.  So, I had stir fry prepared on the mongolian grille, which - despite having only 5 sauces and a very limited selection of veggies - wasn't too bad.

Costumer service is always so humble, which is hard to find now n days, n they are very attentive n keep refills coming, plates off tables n the cost is bout right. 
Now, due to how slow it is , and I'm sure we all understand the logic behind a buffet, food is staying warm due to lights, so we expect sum things needing to get freshen up after a while. But due to its size, n big food selection, I'm sure cost also comes to play here, it's not being done as often as we would like. Years ago when it was busy, fresh food was constantly coming out. which meant constant fresh food and better tasting food. Yes sum things could use updating but this isn't a five star, fancy gourmet restaurant nor r we paying for that loll! So that aspect don't bother me as much. What bothers me the most, is the waterfall right before u come in, It used to be the highlight when u walejd in.

Quiet, friendly service, and a great menu with many different dishes aside from the standard Genetal Tso's Chicken. 

Much like many of the Asian restaurants in this area of town, you may have some apprehensions about going in at first. It can be overwhelming if not awkward, especially for a suburbanite such as myself. But I would encourage you to cast aside any feelings of uneasiness and give this place a try. There is a bit of a language barrier from time to time with some of the servers, but they will always take the time to try to understand what it is you are looking for, and they truly want to make it a pleasant experience for you. I've gotten to know a number of them over the past couple of years, and they're always eager to introduce me to new dishes.  Put yourself out there with a friendly smile, and you'll be amazed at the response you will get. 

On the menu-side of things, I can't say enough about a couple of their dishes in particular. The Korean Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup for example, is piquant with Korean spices, chunks of squid and shrimp, cabbage, carrots, udon noodles. Yum! Other delicious offerings that are a bit more toward the authentic side are the Xinjang Style Lamb (spicy ), Chongquin Casserole () , Boiled Fish in Spicy Szechuan Sauce (), and Mapo Tofu. Don't let the  scare you though, if that's not your thing tell them, and they can tone down the spice for you. 

I'm in there at least once a week for lunch, if not more. I've never had a bad experience at Han, and I often find new things, or specials to try. If you like Chinese, and care to be a little daring, Han is the place to open you up to a while new world of Chinese food.","2018-05-21 20:12:44"

Sure, they have the American-Chinese favorites, but we can just skip that and move on to the things that are less familiar. For me personally, I love Sichuanese flavors. And Han does them right.

Wontons in chili oil are a must everytime, and they always let me take the left over chili oil home. I would be surprised if it wasn't homemade, it has a wonderful flavor with some numbingness from Sichuan peppercorns. Yes, they use them here. If you don't believe me, order the Boiled Beef in Szechuan Sauce. It's as oily, spicy, and numbing as can possibly be imagined; but I would steer-clear if you don't have a high spice-tolerance. My favorite entree is the Chef's Special Dry Chili Chicken, which you can find at other Sichuan restaurants in town but this one is my favorite. The flavor of garlic, ginger, and chilies all stand out and even though it's hot, it's hard not to finish in one sitting. The other two dishes I've tried are the Beef with Celery and Dried Chili, which is hotter than the chili chicken, and the Xinjiang Lamb, which is also known as Cumin Lamb. This is also spicy, but the strong cumin flavor is lovely and mixes with the lamb flavor perfectly. 

The lamb kabobs are also great, with the strong cumin flavor that makes Chinese kabobs so enthralling.

We ordered:

1. Szechuan cold noodles (4/5) - for lack of a better description, it's ""spaghetti"" noodles with spicy sauce and julienned cucumbers. We were confused what this dish was compared to the ""spicy cold noodles"" was; apparently spicy cold noodles refers to the sauce being sesame sauce.

2. Lamb kabobs (5/5) - WOW these were cooked well. It's marinated and garnished with tons of cumin and spice. They were tender, juicy and delicious. I could have definitely polished off the entire entree myself with some rice, but sharing is caring, so I had to split with my friends. Sadness.

3. Boiled beef in hot & spicy sauce (aka Water boiled beef, shui zhu niu) (4.5/5) - For those who haven't had Szechuan food before, this is anything but water boiled. It comes in a giant bowl and looks like a giant soup of pure spicy oil and chili peppers. You fish out the pieces of beef and napa cabbage out and eat it with rice. Yum yum. I liked this, but this one was much spicier than ones at other restaurants, and one of my friends said it was a little salty.

4. Beef noodle soup (5/5) - The dish tasted a lot better than it looked. We weren't too sure what the difference was between this and the ""Szechuan beef noodle soup"" that was listed right below; the waitress just said it was spicy. I'm sure it's also prepared slightly differently too. Sometimes, poorly braised and cut beef is hard to eat and meat gets stuck in your teeth (eww!), but this is not the case here! But the beef was amazingly tender and juicy. The soup was pretty sweet and oily and I actually found myself drinking the soup.

Service was a little slow, but it isn't enough to deter me from coming back. We had finished our food and sat around for 10 minutes before we were able to flag the waitress down to ask for a menu since we wanted to order more food. It was only at that time she cleared our dishes out. It wasn't very busy either, maybe 4 other tables. The restaurant did let us split checks, which was much appreciated.

As a random side note, one of my friends recognized the waitress as possibly having worked at Siam Cafe in the past since he used to eat there 1-2x a week, which was pretty hilarious and ridiculous at the same time.","2014-07-25 01:01:10"

The reviews and menu looked really good so we ordered the lamb kabob, ma po tofu, and walnut shrimp.

The lamb kabob came in 3s for $7.50, the lamb was good but it didn't have the charcoal taste where traditional kabobs had. The seasoning was ok, not too flavorful. But still one few places that has kabobs.

The Ma Po Tofu was really good, very flavorful and numbly like it's suppose to be. It came in a huge bowl so for $10.95 you and someone else can share it just fine. The only thing I would've loved in this dish would be to add some ground pork in it like traditional ma po tofu, I'm not sure if that's an option but I did ask and our waitress didn't really give an answer back.

Lastly we ordered the walnut shrimp, and all I can say is for $17.95 is not worth it. The dish itself was present decently, but the amount of shrimp and size of it was just not worth the price of the dish itself. The taste was ok, We've had better at different Chinese restaurant, so again if you really want to spend the money on it for an ok dish then go for it.

The service was bad and we were the only ones at the place. We sat down not even 30 seconds in and asked what to drink while we didn't even have a chance to see what they had to offer. Then we looked thru the menu and was ready to order, we couldn't get their attention for the life of us unless we yelled which we didn't. The waitress that took our order had an attitude whenever I asked a question. She really had an attitude when I asked for one more of bowl of rice when the ma po tofu was such a huge bowl and you cannot finish that dish with just one bowl of rice.

At the end we asked for our check to realize that we were charged for the extra bowl of rice, and she didn't tell us it was extra. They lastly took five minutes to cash us out so at the end we were more annoyed.

Overall food was good had better, I think next time I'll just order takeout if I ever come back. It would've been a 4 stars if the service wasn't bad. Then I gave it a 3 stars due to the price of some of their stuff were overprice, and I felt that the extra rice shouldn't be extra if you're dinning in.","2019-04-10 13:04:26"

My wife and I ate here for New Years Eve a few years ago and it was still pretty good, 4 out of 5 stars.  Have gone about once every few months in recent years.

We went back this past Sunday, first time in about 6 months, and wow, the trend seems to be escalating.

Men's room had a little bit of graffiti.

Wok area for 'custom' stir fry was never manned; I didn't bother to ask.

Boneless spare ribs were disgusting, tons of cartiledge and fat.  More of that than meat.

Chicken on a stick, a regular favorite of my 6 year old's, was found to be tough and dried out.

General tso's - very chewy meat, overbreaded on top of that.  I shouldn't even call it meat, makes me sick thinking about it.

The spring roll my wife bit into was terrible, the oil literally came pouring out!

The won ton I tried seemed to be a day old.  The dough was tough and dry.

The hot tea was not good.  Weak and poor taste.

I was sick the next morning.  Now maybe it wasn't from this meal, I can't say for sure.

Since they are fairly close to home and since we have been patrons from the very beginning, I will probably give them one more chance.  In a few months, when hopefully they have had the time to make some changes.  If they improve, I will definitely come back here and update the review as I have for other reviews before.

Update 11/10/14
I promised we'd give it another shot.  We went yesterday.  The pineapple chicken is quite stringy.  Chicken on a stick was decent this time.  General Tso's didn't feel like good chicken.  Crab rangoons were very short on filling compared to better places.  Bathrooms are again kind of nasty, not necessarily disgusting but beat up and in disrepair.  They've made a couple improvements, I will bring them up to 2 stars. The value isn't bad and the selection is huge, but there's a reason teh tables aren't packed.","2013-07-03 19:30:51"

For a group of ~6 people, I would typically order their green beans (tastes great with dried chili and with garlic), Ë®Öóô~ (it's a spicy fish dish), salt and pepper chicken wings (I prefer them over the pork because the chicken wings are much less fatty), ¼týÈâ (hong sue pork on the menu - it's a more fatty cut of beef that is braised for hours and is absolutely delicious), Chinese rice cakes, and their lamb kebabs (they come in orders of 3 and you can choose to either eat them spiced or not-spiced, great both ways!). I've also had their beef noodle soup, which is also excellent! But if you're sharing family style, it is a little harder to portion that amongst the group. You don't need to order white rice - that usually comes automatically with your food. But just in case, make sure to order it!! The food is very flavorful and the rice will do a good job of balancing it out. 

If you have trouble deciding how much to order, one of the waiters recommended that you order one dish per person, even if you're sharing. But I've found that you can err on the side of ordering a little less. If you end up wanting more food, it's easy to just add a dish on. The food comes out pretty quickly (within ~10 min). It can end up being a little pricier; I usually pay $15-20 for a meal. But it's honestly VERY worth the price.","2019-07-06 19:44:20"

So I asked the young lady at the counter what was in it. She informed me that it was carrots, onions, chicken and sauce. (I asked because I do not like green peppers or mushrooms.) When I get home and sit down to eat I realize that Basil Chicken actually consists of mostly mushrooms and green peppers, with chicken basil and chili peppers. It didn't even contain carrots or onions. Needles to say I was unhappy that I was not served what I was told I was getting. I was quite hungry and didn't want to go back out into the cold so I tried to eat some of the chicken. 

Since it was their mistake I figured they would make it right. I called to complain. The young lady told me, that I should just pick the mushrooms and peppers out. I explained that the dish was mostly mushrooms and peppers and I asked for a refund. She informed me that since I had already eaten some of it, that they wouldn't be able to serve it to someone else! Yikes I sure hope that they don't re-sell food that customers have taken home with them!
After this exchange I offered her the option of refunding my money or permanently loosing me as a customer. She replied, ""I don't care!"" and hung up on me.
At no point during this call did she apologize for her errors in describing what I was ordering.

That's what they want you to think.

Inside there are turtles and angels. The turtles loaf around doing turtle things in a wee fountain near the entrance. The angels wear uniforms and patiently wait by the cash register to seat you. The ethereal wait staff put you at ease, soothing you for the culinary onslaught to come, and bring you enough Dr Pepper to drown a capybara.  

I apologize, but I'm vegan. So I can't really rate most of the fare at the buffet. But I can tell you that my friends are happier than chimpanzees at war when they're stuffing their faces with delicacies like ""cheese crab"" and ""salt and pepper frog."" 

As far as the vegan food is concerned, the stir-fry tofu is my hero (it comes with baby corns!!) and the sesame seed sweet potato (I call them ""squishy balls"") shall marry my firstborn son. There's also some savory curry fries, green beans, plenty of rice (duh), and oh screw it, just LOAD UP ON TOFU.

I really want to submit a bunch of inside jokes that have been developed at A Panda Buffet. But you wouldn't understand references to space cats, red goo sauce, or hot dog bread. Point is, this isn't only a place to gorge yourself on perfectly decent Chinese food until it seeps out of your eyeballs and drips onto your distended belly, it's a place to meet with friends, fall in love, give birth to a baby girl, bury your favorite cat, or run a small money-laundering operation.

The general layout hasn't changed - this location has that cozy college campus feel to it - but what has changed is the menu and displays. I remember when I first came here the only options were noodle soups and, well, noodles! Now you can find salads and sandwiches, and even better for those of us watching our waistlines, there's calorie measurements next to the entree listings.

The soups are all delicious, the veggie sandwiches are also quite simply wonderful, and the noodle dishes I've had have been tasty enough considering that what I'm ordering isn't as expensive as the pasta dishes at my favorite Italian places.

Currently, the older woman who now works the register and seats folks is shrewish at best.  And it does not appear to be the result of any cultural divide or a desire to be ""efficient,"" as a previous reviewer suggested.  I have multiple times tried to engage her with a smile and make eye contact, but she--without fail--comes across apathetic and even angry. 

Last 3 times, she drops food at our table without acknowledging us (today in such a hurry that today she swapped our drinks and our food--last time it was just the drinks).  She then turns without making eye contact.  I actually thought one or both of us had irritated her, but my buddy from work said she is always that way.  He would characterize her as rude as well.

I have not had the sushi or Chinese (neither of which, unfortunately, look appealing), so my review is based solely on the yummy hibachi food.  

Upon ordering, you have a choice of meats (chicken, steak, shrimp or veggies), with shrimp, I think, being the most expensive at $6.75.  You also have your choice of steamed or Chinese fried rice. Steamed, in my opinion, is the only way to go here, lest you upset the delicate harmony of flavors once you add all the different sauces. The sauces! I'll get back to that in a minute...

So once you're paid up and you choose your options,a friendly hibachi guy will throw a generous portion of your chosen protein and veggies (onions, zucchini, mushrooms) onto the superhot grill, tossing everything together while occasionally adding a big pat from this giant cone of butter that hangs out next to the grill. When the food is almost done, a very tasty teriyaki sauce and sesame seeds are added to the stirfry.

There are several condiments available, and I have found my perfect combination - two little tubs of the meat sauce (a sweet soy sauce w/ ginger and garlic), a tub of seafood sauce (creamy horseradish sauce) and one tub of crushed chili pepper in chili oil. I toss those sauces with the steamed rice and veggies and it is just...perfect!

Ideally, you will have a friend with you to split the order - I have never finished a whole one by myself, and I am definitely not a light eater!!

BTW, another plus: one of the only Arcade (either Colonial or Hyatt Regency) food vendors (I think Vincenzas is the only other one) that is not cash only... Sometimes, I just don't have time to walk to my bank to get cash, so being able to use plastic for a fast and cheap lunch is great!","2012-11-11 18:49:45"

As I write this, I can't decide whether to give it three or four stars. I'm torn. I feel like maybe I can't fairly judge Doodles, because most restaurants on campus aren't at their peak during spring break. However, it's the only time I ever go to campus, because of the difficulty of navigating campus while classes are in session. Hence my indecision!
Here's why it deserves four stars:
It's cheap. The service was quick and friendly. Doodles does ramen, and little else. I hear they have spam musubis, but there were none to be found yesterday, probably due to spring break. I'd almost definitely give Doodles 4 stars (nay, 5!) if they had good spam musubis. Sigh. I liked the ingredient list. It's a good idea. The portions were generous. Boyfriend bought lunch, and 2 pretty loaded doodles (he had Aloha, I had sesame doodle with spam, egg and fried tofu) plus a soda was 8.75. Hawaii-native boyfriend was very pleased with the Aloha doodle, which had fish cake, seaweed, and other things I don't eat, plus spam! Spam would've been better crispy and fried, but I always feel that way. 

Here's why I want to give it three stars:
It's ramen. Sure, there are fancy toppings, but it's just Maruchen/Top Ramen. A freeze-dried block of noodles. So it's cheap... but not *that* cheap if you consider what goes in it. I could've duplicated my doodle at home for less than two dollars, but paid 1.75 for the sesame base, plus 1.00 for spam, and .50 each for the hard-boiled egg and fried tofu.The decor is cute and kind of trendy, but there isn't a lot of seating. Our group of 7 had to find somewhere else to eat. It also took a while for all of us to be served, though the guy working (the proprietor, I believe) was totally nice and engaging. See, I'm not being fair, and I know it, because it's meant to be food to take and go, not a place for a leisurely group lunch. Still, my gut feeling about my Doodles experience is just A-OK. 

All in all, I'm glad I went to Doodles.. once. I doubt I'll be back. If I were in college, I'd really like Doodles, I bet. I'd probably eat there regularly. It's fast, cheap, customizable - what more could you want?

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Mission Statement: Try ALL the beef noodle soups
Mission Justification: Beef noodle soup is really freakin' delicious.
Secondary Justification: It's winter and I really freakin' love soup.
TEAM:
Team Lead: Me
Team Members: Husband, Friends who can be dragged to various Taiwanese/Chinese restaurants
SMEs: Fellow Yelpers
ACTION ITEMS/NEXT STEPS:
[1] Go to as many Taiwanese/Chinese restaurants as possible.
[2] Order the beef noodle soup.
[3] Slurp.

Now that that's out of the way, here's what I tried at Ting's:

HOT & SOUR SOUP: a fairly standard cornstarchy favorite.  Packed with egg swirls and veg/tofu matter.  Not bad, but needed some peppercorn action and was vastly improved by the hot sauce (a chunky chili paste) I asked for.  Then again, what isn't?

PORK & HOT PEPPER: husband's order.  Not very special.   I tried to talk some sense into him, I swear, but tragically failed.  Would suggest one of the more traditional dishes--anything ""over rice"" or the zha jiang mian (sort of like a Taiwanese spaghetti bolognese).

That's it.  Har har, I'm hilarious.

BEEF NOODLE SOUP: decently flavorful broth though not as rich and deep as Rose Tea Cafe's.  The beef was a huge step up though, though it was NOT tendon, as the menu advertised, but thick chunks of a nice fatty cut with some gelatinous bits.  Not completely flavorless, as most soup meat tends to me.  I ate the gelatinous connecty bits and left the rest for hubby, as I often do.  [SIDEBAR: depending on who you are, you likely feel he's incredibly fortunate to be with a girl who likes the ""weird"" bits/cuts of meat, as this leaves him with the prime cuts, OR that his life is incredibly sad.  If you're the latter, let's be friends.]  Noodles were nothing special--not fresh or handmade.  Toppings included some fairly bland chopped pickled mustard greens and a halved stalk of baby bok choy.
BNS SCORE: 2.5/5

Our friends ordered the SIMPLE NOODLE SOUP WITH PORK/SHRIMP, BRAISED BEEF OVER RICE, and ROAST PORK MINIS.  I'm devastated to report that not only did I not try them, I woefully neglected to even ask how they liked them.  Though, judging by the fact that they had both cleaned their plates when my soup bowl still looked untouched, I'd say they didn't hate it.

No free desserts here, our meal ended with your typical nonsensical fortune cookies.  We did receive some fried wonton chips with dipping sauce to start.  One item of note, however, is that the service here is very much above average for an East Asian eatery.  Maybe it's because I was at a table with 3 white people and they profiled us (we also received forks and no chopsticks), but I believe they actually came by at one point to ask how we were doing.

I arrived for lunch. Got seated right away since there were not a lot of people. I asked my waiter about the change. He told me they are still working on it and the full menu has not been completely changed out yet.

The first few pages of the menu is your typical Chinese American flare which you would find at almost any restaurant. The last couple of pages which has Chinese writing on the side is your Szechuan menu. If you want to know what is on the Taiwanese menu then you have to ask your waiter for those menu items.

A lot of the Szechuan items I was told were authentic Chinese food and much of it is very spicy. i lot of those items were pork items but they had some items that were chicken, lamb, and even fish. I asked the waiter what kind of chicken they use for that preparation and I was told dark meat because it is ""tastier"" when preparing Szechuan foods. I was exploring the fish options and he recommended one which came with Tofu. Normally it comes very spicy but I can order it non-spicy if I so chose and would get a dinner portion for a dinner price. Note-there are some items on this menu which you can get a lunch portion on and save some money.

I asked about what kind of fish it was and it was something I never heard of. I was debating whether or not I should order it bland but then I thought that it would be tasteless unless it has some flavor to it. So I decided to stick with the American side and ordered chicken breast with vegetables. Since it came as a lunch portion I ordered that. You have a choice of fried or white rice and one side which can either be a soup or spring roll. I opted for the spring roll.

When I got the roll I found it a bit difficult to cut with my knife but it was otherwise okay. My main course arrived shortly afterwards and it was a smaller portion with  enough basic fried rice. It was good but very similar to what you would get at most other Chinese restaurants.

I was given a bagged fortune cookie and wasn't offered a dessert as I had seen in other reviews. However, when I got my check it was written on it 5% discount if you pay in cash. I'll take a break like that anytime so I was able to get that discount once I told them I'd pay in cash. 

This place is okay but I still prefer the one I ate at in Mt Lebanon earlier in the summer. It will be interesting to see what happens once they complete their renovations and put in the rest of the Taiwanese menu.  I was able to chat with some people at the next table who had ordered the Szechuan lamb dish and although the portion was generous I was told it was spicy hot! Please keep that in mind if you can't handle hot spicy foods.","2016-10-05 20:35:07"

It was a Thursday night around 6 and the place was busy.  It's not a huge place to begin with (seats maybe 35?), you're all kind of close in, so no privacy.  It didn't bother me, but it did noticeably bother two girls that sat adjacent to me.

The thing that did bother me was the noise.  With all of the hard wall/floor/ceiling surfaces, but we're all kind of packed in a small area, plus everyone's talking, the tipping point on the noise was the piped in music.  It was Loud with a capital L.  Was this a nightclub or a casual restaurant?

Since I was there by myself it wasn't a deal breaker, but I would have had trouble carrying on a conversation with a mealmate.

The service at the counter was pleasant and efficient and it took very little time to get my food; I ordered the bankok curry noodle dish (regular) vegetarian style.

The Japanese-style soda machine is kind of cool.  I chose Diet Raspberry Diet Coke.  In a word:  don't.  Raspberry goes well with Sprite and iced tea, but Diet Coke?  Not so much.

Noodles & Company is a healthful alternative to fast food.  It you keep your dish as is without adding meat/tofu, with a drink it's about $7.50.  If you have a more hearty appetite, you'd do better at Chipotle or Qdoba, or if you're hankering Asian food, nearby non-chain Spice Island.

Final verdict:  does in a pinch, when I'm not starving, but not a restaurant I'd actively seek out to eat.","2012-12-15 01:21:34"

2) During the rush our (11:30 to 1 pm), the food is often undercooked and is unnecessarily oily.

The location is set in the greasy pit of campus-town, where I hesitate to venture unless compelled to by some supernatural force (like the lure of hot noodles in winter).

The interior space of this tiny shop is not exactly comfortable, but this is the unfortunate case with most campus businesses (i.e., furniture and surfaces should be able to withstand physical punishment from college students).  For those choosing to dine inside, there's a picnic-style bench and a counter with stools.  I guess I can't hold the lack of interior design against them because the restaurant is not attempting to follow a conventional theme.  

The manager explained the primary concept behind the place is ""food-to-go"" (so students can eat something while running around campus), and all the food is packaged for such a purpose, including the noodles.  Next to the front counter is a cooler with various drinks (both American sodas and Asian fruit juices) and ""snack"" foods.  From what I observed, the same snack foods aren't served each day, though I haven't gone often enough to figure out the pattern/rotation of the different foods.  These were a few dishes I noticed during my visits: glutinous rice balls (classic snack served in Taiwan and other parts of China), Chinese steamed buns, edamame, various sushi rolls, vegetarian gyoza, and spam musubi (a Japanese-Hawaiian invention that probably deserves a certain skepticism from most diners). 

Of course, the main feature of this shop is ramen.  When I mention this, most people respond indignantly, ""What!?  You can buy ramen for 40 cents at Wal-Mart!""  The ramen-eating experience here is NOT the same as boiling noodles and adding sauce packets in your own home, though.  Your ramen bowl is fully customizable, from the available broths (sesame, miso, kimchi, beef, seafood, etc.) to the toppings you can request for your bowl (baby bok choy, nappa, egg, fried tofu, wakame, Thai fish cakes, beef meatballs, etc.).  At around 50 cents per topping, I was initially expecting pretty skim offerings, but I actually get a pretty decent ratio of noodles to vegetables.

If you Wikipedia it you'll find that they're processed, fried-dried carbs invented by a Japanese man back in the 50's. Apparantly they've reached a certain level of affordable yet haute cuisine in Japan since then and that's basically the experience Doodles tries to give you.

I'm Asian, specifically Korean-American (according to Wikipedia Koreans eat the most ramen noodles per capita in the world) but  I grew up like most of you eating cheap ramen you can get for ten cents at Wal-Mart. I've never been to a fancy ramen shop. I would say you can take my Asian card but it's been revoked since I was in junior high and said eff off to the Korean Jesus freaks that dotted my suburban landscape.

But that's neither here nor there. At the end of the day, as Sarah Palin once famously said, you can't put lipstick on a pig. Essentially, that's what this is.

Ordered 2 servings of chicken fried rice, 1 order of Ho Fun noodles with chicken, and a side of white rice. The man at the front desk was very welcoming and helpful, as I asked him about two of the noodle bowls and what they contained.

Undortunately, the food is rather....bland. It wasn't that bad, since when I put soy sauce on it , both dishes tasted much better.

It's a variety of noodle preparations ""from around the world"" including Asian, Mediterranean, etc. I have been going to various locations for 10 years and always come back: although there is an occasional error or less than ideal situation, you can't beat the variety, price, and convenience if you are a pasta lover like myself. I have had most of the dishes dozens of times- here are some thoughts:

Japanese pan noodles: the noodles are thick with a great mouthfeel. The sauce is a little spicy and tasty. Sometimes they don't put enough on there though and it winds up on the flavorless side

Buttered noodles: literally butter and noodles (and a very nice seasoning plus parm) but the egg noodles are very tasty and I often use this as a vehicle to add whatever fresh ingrediants they have in seasons ( mmm corn and asparagus)

Steak stroganoff: really tasty sauce but rich. Would get the small size 

Pasta fresca: one of my go-tos. It has delicate wine sauce that I can't get enough of. Nice veggies as well

Penne rosa: I sometimes feel like the sauce tastes like vomit 

Mac and cheese: literally don't understand why people like this! So plain and basic!

Pad Thai: inedible. You are much better off going to a Thai restaurant 

Indian curry: delicious! Not a lot of noodles but good if you want more of a mix of veggies 

Pesto cavatappi: a nice dish but I would ask for extra sauce because often it runs a little low

I've been wanting to go here for a while now, and I finally did after I saw a buy-one-get-one free ad on their Facebook page. The restaurant is in a weird spot, as the door isn't on the street-side of the building but rather on the building's side because Insomnia Cookies takes up the front of the building. The interior is fairly small, with two booths and several stools for seating along the walls. 

I told the person working the register that it was my first time, and he was very nice and went through the menu with me. You choose a flavor and then any number of toppings you want--they have a rather large selection so it can be hard to decide, so luckily they have a list of popular combinations you can choose from if you don't feel like experimenting. After you pay and receive your ramen, you fill the bowl with hot water, wait, stir, and enjoy. 

The prices are very reasonable (usually between $2-$5) compared to other places on campus that can provide a quick lunch, and I was happily surprised to find that I was very full on my walk home. My only complaint is that everything is served in large styrofoam cups, even if you're eating in (I could be wrong though, maybe I should have specified when ordering). Doodles often posts really good specials on their Facebook page, making the prices even sweeter. 

If you're a college student looking for something different than the typical foods offered on Green Street, walk a block south and Give Doodle's a try!

I came in on ""Free Doodle Day"" and I fell in love! Located in the heart of a college campus, this place is busy every time I stop by! Despite the hidden location, people are bustling in and out of this place.

Another great thing about Doodles is the price. Cups are around $2-$5 and it's about the size of a styrofoam soup container. Along comes a cute little label on the side too!

Got penne rosa (my other usual staple here) and it was bland that time! The tomato bisque was okay though, but again was lukewarm for some reason. I would assume soups are made in bulk and spooned out as they're ordered, so are they simply not kept in proper containers?

I had never been here before but i passed it once and was curious about what Taiwanese was like. So my husband and I took our nephews here and we looked over the menu and decided on some pretty interesting things. I order the chilled kidney along with the intestines that are served in a hot pot. My husband ordered Duck and some fried rice for the rest of the table. He's not much into trying new things.

The kidney came out first and was surprisingly delicious. It has the consistency of squid but not so much the flavor. They marinated the kidney in a spicy sauce that had a lot of oil in it. The intestines were even better they came out in a wok style dish with a little flame underneath to keep it hot and bubbly. There were green onions, white onions and a few peppers to compliment this dish.

The duck was very delicious, some of the best I have ever had. I don't know whether they barbecued it or marinated it but it had a delicious smoky and sweet flavor to it. Plus duck is  fattier so it wasn't dry like how chicken & turkey can be sometimes. The fried rice was a good complement to the side dish. The only thing that I didn't like was that a lot of the food was cooked in way too much oil. Other than that the spices were very good and the presentation was as well.

As such, this will be a quick review unlike my usual ones.

My wife and I headed here for dinner because I was excited to order their chongqing chicken. We ordered the red chili dumplings as our appetizer and they were decent and comparable to others we have gotten recently.  Then for dinner I went with the chongqing chicken while my wife ordered the salt and pepper squid.  My chicken came out first and actually was quite good.  It was hot temperature wise and super crunchy.  Actually it was some of the better fried chicken that I have had recently.  There also was some numbing from the Szechuan peppercorns but what I thought the dish was really missing was some spice.  Yeah it had the dried red peppers on it but I never had to take a drink of water.  After finishing my dish I started to help my wife with hers.  The squid itself was overcooked and so chewy and the whole dish felt rather dry.  After having only a few bites we noticed the item in the dish that shouldn't have been there and immediately called a manager over.  They thought it was a rice noodle at first but we persisted and they saw it wasn't.  At that point they assured us not to worry and that it wasn't a big deal and that they would bring us another.  Umm, no thanks.  They did take it off of our bill and my wife and I quickly paid and headed out of the restaurant.

The bottom line for me is that I won't be heading back here again in the future.  While mistakes do happen, I actively avoid places where you find something in your food that shouldn't be there.","2018-03-11 03:55:08"

I ordered the Pasta Fresca with chicken and my son got the Buttered noodles. We received our order and we got exactly what I noticed.

Noodles & Company isn't particularly affordable, and in Oakland, you'll be able to find better Pad Thai or meatballs spaghetti in other establishments within a 3 minute walking radius from Noodles & Company - so I have a tough time understanding the niche this particular franchise seeks to fill. 

I had the BBQ Pork Mac and Cheese and Tomato Basil Bisque. The mac and cheese, while perfectly acceptable, reminded me of the Kraft variety you'll find in virtually every Freshman dorm. The bisque, also perfectly acceptable, could have been replicated by thickening a canned offering from Campbell's with some sauteed onions and a dash of heavy cream.

The service required at Noodles & Company isn't complicated - and consists of a cashier taking your order, line cooks doing their thing and a runner will bring it to your table.

In addition, the runner decided to offer unsolicited commentary on the volume of food we had ordered. 

While I don't believe that America's tipping culture necessarily guarantees good service, you can certainly tell when a Sphincter ani externus in the service industry isn't counting on tips to live (Noodles & Company's policy prohibits tipping).

There are a lot of options, so I would take some time reading the menu that they have hanging on the right side of the line to the cashier. The menu behind the cashier doesn't have the same descriptions. Many items don't include meat, by the way-- it's an extra $2.50+. So if you do want a meal with meat in it, it comes out to ~$10+

The shoyu broth was surprisingly good. I expected it to be one of those low-quality broth powders but to my pleasant surprise they actually concocted their own shoyu-paste. I believe it was topped with cilantro and garlic.

The noodles, however, were just your typical cheap 10 cent top-ramen that I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE (imported) instant ramen noodles and I eat them almost daily which is a horrible idea, but I just don't like the oily, saturated fat-ridden 10 cent top ramen noodles. They're cheap for a reason. 

If you add toppings, the total price should come out to be around $3-$4 which is cheap for lunch, but expensive for ramen noodles. For deals-conscious college kids, $3-4 range can get you many things; 2 huge slices of ""gourmet"" pizzas on monday at Antonios, a philly cheesesteak at Penn Station (their Nov-Dec promotional price), hotdogs/brats at the beef stand, etc. I don't know if Doodles can rival these deals on the quality of food just yet.

The thai curry soup was actually quite delicious with pieces of spinach, mushrooms and carrots but the noodles were a little undercooked making them hard and almost unpalatable.  The pan noodle in the small portion is quite small and the sauce was good (super salty!!) but but the noodles were on the dry side.  The shrimp were a little gross, they weren't fresh and had the weird taste that cheap frozen shrimp have.  There were about 6 small shrimp in the dish. 

On my second visit I ordered the pad thai and was completely disappointed.  There were barely any pieces of egg and what was in the dish were dried precooked pieces of egg that were thrown in when the dish was assembled.  

This place is unique in that it offers many different types of pasta and noodle dishes but it is far from authentic when it comes to the Asian choices from what I've tried so far.  The novelty of this place has caught Oakand's attention as this place is constantly busy and always has a line during peak times.  It is convenient and relatively fast and the prices are on par with the panera across the street.  But I highly recommend that Pitt students and others take their money to the numerous small businesses in Oakland.  Noodles & Company is a chain that tries to grasp authenticity but never quite makes it there.  I suggest Lulu's noodles on Craig street for pad thai, their scrambled eggs for the pad thai are made to order and not scant in quantity like in N&C's meager and almost pitiful dish.  

I looked on their website and they do offer a free meal to people who sign up for their email list on their birthday, I signed up as my birthday is in a few days.  I find that I will probably frequent this place more than I honestly wish to.  I gave this chain three stars for the convenience, speed and overall package of this place; at least its not another mcdonalds.","2012-01-30 17:30:13"

What's Hot
- Quality.  Delish!  Cali girl here who grew up with home made Chinese food.  I've also eaten the real stuff overseas.  Trust me, dudes, I know!  The food was absolutely delicious and flavorful.  The stewed pork belly was tender and melt in your mouth.  The flavor/marinade was absorbed in the belly fat, which melted in my mouth.  The woodear mushroom was well seasoned with sesame oil, raw minced garlic, and chili oil.  Flavorful, not too spicy but had a kick, and crunchy yet tender.  The stir fried watercress had a good amount of sliced garlic on it and it was not overly salty, which is super important, because the freshness and flavor weren't masked.  Good quality Chinese food is hard to find, especially when it comes to certain dishes.   
- Layout.  There are booths and tables that can accommodate groups.  From what I could see, their largest table probably accommodates 8 people.  I came by myself after work, bringing work with me.  They sat me at a booth, which allowed me to spread out my work.
- Menu.  Not Asian fusion, which is something I appreciate.  Good variety, especially when it comes to Taiwanese dishes.  Many of the dishes on the menu are not common dishes, such as woodear mushroom, za jian mian, pork belly dishes, tendon, etc...  Their menu is also written in Chinese, which I appreciate.  Their staff and much of their clientele are native Chinese speakers, as well.  No offense, dudes, but in my experience eating at ethnic restaurants, the best ones are when the staff speak the language and personally know and eat the dishes.    
- Location.  Convenient location surrounded by other shops and restaurants.  It's in a conveniently located plaza with a large parking lot, which is helpful.  However, I'm certain that also means that this place could get busy during ""rush hour"".  So, be prepared.
- Service.  I came by myself and brought work with me, so I was eating and working at the same time.  However, the wait staff didn't push me.  It helped that the restaurant wasn't crowded, but that they didn't push me out was still appreciated.

What's Not
- Price.  The stewed pork belly over rice is $6, but the stir fried watercress is $13.  That surprised me.  My total tab was around $30 for 3 dishes, which seemed a bit high.  To be fair, fresh produce is more expensive.  On the other hand, you are paying for good quality.  
- Portions.  I was surprised the pork belly over rice was as small as it was.  For $6, it wasn't that bad.  However, it looked like the portions at this restaurant are not so much family size.  If you come in a group, be prepared to order more food to feed everyone.
- Service.  After I paid my bill, they pretty much left me alone.  They didn't refill my water glass or anything.  I've been in restaurants where we stick around after paying the bill, but the wait staff will still check in and refill water glasses.  That I didn't get that bummed me out.  Just goes to show that every restaurant is different.

Appetizer of cold sesame noodles was inedible and nothing like any cold sesame noodles I've ever had. Overcooked Italian linguine noodles with a sour, soy-based sauce and some sesame seeds. It was truly terrible. Thankfully, they were removed from our bill.

Replaced with Dan Dan Noodles, which varied greatly from others I've had elsewhere. Basically a small bowl of noodles with oil and hot pepper flakes. Edible but nothing special.

Pot Stickers were bland and so completely burnt on the bottom that the taste was nearly ruined.

My companion had wanton soup and szechuan chicken; I had hot and sour soup and vegetable chow mein.  Her soup was so bad she didn't eat it; mine was also not good.    Hot and sour soup is one of the things I always get to test out a new Chinese place, and this is one of the worst I've had.  It had a very cloudy appearance, almost like gravy.  Neither of our entrees were good.  Mine was almost exclusively bean sprouts, and had not much flavor at all.  Hers just had a bad taste.  The worst were the sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard they keep on the table.  They were so watery and oddly dark brown.

As the name suggests, they specialize in noodles, which includes American and Italian-inspired types as well as the Asian-inspired ones you might think of.  I've tried several varieties here and at the downtown location, including the penne rosa, pesto cavatappi, and mac and cheese.  Although the dishes may not be the most exciting ones you'll find in the area, all of them have been served hot, have tasted good, and have been filling, providing for a solid lunch (or dinner, in the case of my downtown excursions).  The small size is perfect for a lunch portion, whereas the larger size is better for dinner, and meat can be added for an upcharge.  I've tried the parmesan chicken (on the pesto cavatappi) and the BBQ pork (on the macaroni), and both have been tasty and have gone well with these dishes.

Although I don't usually order a drink, as other reviewers have mentioned, they have the Coke freestyle machine, which provides for unlimited flavor customization options.

We tried both the Szechuan and Taiwanese dishes.  And I am looking forward to their new Taiwanese menu.  

Boiling beef (Szechuan) - the beef was soft and done right.  But the sauce was nothing but salty and spicy.  it is supposed to be more complex than that.  and to be honest there are better Szechuan restaurants in squirrel hill area. (3/5)

Taiwan chicken nuggets (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=NLq9ud9hNAw-QnFpv7V3aw)  crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  I think it is thigh meat not breast meat, which would be a plus. but i am not 100% sure. (4/5)

Taiwan pork rice (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=4LUy7n-J7Ca9jZE44QF_hg)  it is really really good. but rather small.  I have heard they do lunch box / set dinner version too, hopefully those will be bigger. (5/5)

Zhangcha duck.  The biggest surprise of the night.  Crispy skin and fat enough duck.  (6/5)

There were few more dishes too. and free dessert (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=k8IU71im9pTAWFiiSEVz8g)

I was excited to try this place as there are only a few authentic Taiwanese restaurant in the area. But after trying it out, I don't think this is even close to authentic as the other options in Pittsburgh. I had the wonton in chili oil and the chicken steak over rice. Both of these are the easy, basic but tasty dish from each cuisine(they claim to be Taiwanese and Szechuan cuisine). 
The wonton came out first, but it was super salty and the filling didn't taste fresh. I would say 2 out of 5. Not a good start. After a little bit, the chicken steak was ready. Nice presentation! It came with some boiled pok choy on the side. First impression of this dish was authentic. Soon I found out that the chicken steak was weird, thickness wise. I've never had chicken steak in my life that was like this. I'm not saying it has to be like a prefect steak. But this is way off. Some parts were half inch thick, which turned out to be the best part, they were juicy but there were only 2-3 pieces like that. Then there are some ones were like paper thin which of course it would be over fried and too dry. So I think the chef defiantly need make some changes on this. 

The taste were alright, the chicken itself doesn't have any flavor, it is solely rely on the seasoning powder, but the powder only covers the top chicken. So, I had some plain fried chicken. At least it came with pork gravy over rice, that was pretty good. 

So,  overall, It didn't live up my expectation. Lot of room to grow. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who is interested in authentic Taiwanese or Szechuan experience.

The interior is probably still undergoing some changes, but it does leave a bit to be desired. On the other hand, the food here is decent. I tried Zhajiang Mian, a typical noodle dish which I found to be alright in my opinion. The taste was decent although it would be nice if the cooks cut the ginger into smaller pieces so as to obscure the taste of the ginger (it still gets the job done in smaller pieces, no?). As for the Beef Noodle Soup with Tendon, I found it be acceptable. Wish there were more noodles and the beef was alright. The soup was probably the best part of the dish. The scallion pancakes here are on point ... I really like the little bit of sauce that is included with the appetizer. Adds a nice flavor to the individual pancake pieces although the dish stands well on its own, too.

It was decently priced, which was great since we ordered A LOT of food.  Unfortunately, the saving grace from all of that food was the wonton soup.  A lot of what we ordered was pitched.  The lo mein had absolutely no flavor whatsoever and the noodles weren't what was traditionally served for lo mein.  My boyfriends General Tso chicken was absolutely LOADED with onion, which made us think they were trying to make up for lack of flavor.  The egg rolls were alright, and the lemon chicken tasted sort of plain.  I didn't happen to try the fried wontons, but my friend said they were good.

Yesterday I placed a take out order over the phone and the process was quick, pleasant, and easy! I came to pick up my food about 30 minutes later and everything was fresh. 

On the way home I couldn't help but eat one of my veggie spring rolls. They are INCREDIBLE: Crispy, obviously hand made, and mildly spicy. The filling had a fantastic texture with the outside providing a lovely crunch. Probably the best spring rolls I've had anywhere. 

Along with my order I also got tempura vegetables, wonton soup, and two sweet and sour chicken entrees. The tempura vegetables were a wide assortment of vegetables in a delicious coating. I saw green bell peppers, broccoli, zucchini, onion, eggplant?, and snap peas, among other things. I didn't personally have the wonton soup, but I was told it was similarly yummy!

When we got to our sweet and sour chicken entrees, I realized that they had accidentally given me shrimp instead of chicken. I called in, hoping to correct the issue, and the handling of this mistake was some of the best customer service I've experienced anywhere. The polite person that answered the phone was apologetic and offered several options for correcting the issue. I chose to have the chicken remade and picked it up. When I got there, they were so friendly in making sure I definitely received the correct order. In addition, they gave us coupon off of our next order. This was above and beyond for me. 

The chicken was WELL WORTH the wait. It was amazing. The coating was deliciously onion-y and the sweet and sour sauce was more nuanced than the corn syrup-y messes I'm used to. I would definitely highly recommend their sweet and sour chicken. 

Due to the superb customer service (even in times of mistake), the absolutely delicious, fresh to order food, and the very fair prices for the quality, this restaurant will become my go-to for takeout. I hope to update my review soon when I am able to dine-in.","2018-02-28 22:52:42"

I ordered the lamb in sichuan style (17.95), the lamb was thinly sliced and was mixed with veggies with a hint of spice. It also comes with a side of rice. My mom ordered the zha jiang noodles with ground pork. It comes with brown sauce! The portions are really large, which is always a plus. I did give my moms dish a try and I loved it! So tasty!! Our waitress was nice enough to bring out a few dishes for us to sample different Taiwanese style foods. The one plate was filled with Taiwanese Chicken Steak (amazing), there was nothing boring about this chicken and it was extremely flavorful! The second bowl was noodle soup with pork and shrimp also very delicious! The last plate was the Taiwanese Pork Buns, these were also very tasty and a bit crispy which I like! To end this fabulous dinner she brought out Taiwanese grass/honey jelly and lemon jelly for dessert.

Never again!!!!","2018-09-23 17:29:44"

There is a American Chinese menu and a smaller menu of more tradional dishes.  The egg drop soup was decent, with a thinner broth than many other places. Hot and sour, the same, it was decent as well.
The stars of this Westlake establishment were the whole flounder and Chinese Broccoli. Flounder was very nice enough for 2 people. Simple, steamedwith soy, grean onions, little bit of ginger and garlic. Next the Chinese broccoli, sliced with a very light garlic sauce and cooked perfectly.  Well done.","2019-11-25 17:12:51"

We ended up ordering 5 dishes for the 3 of us.  Not sure how but we ended up cleaning every single plate.  The food is very authentic and we'll be coming back.","2019-01-02 03:07:07"
